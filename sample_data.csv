"On November 5th, 1990, a man named El Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane, the leader of the Jewish Defense League. Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder, but while serving time on lesser charges, he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks, including tunnels, synagogues and the United Nations headquarters. Thankfully, those plans were foiled by an FBI informant. Sadly, the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not. Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot. El Sayyid Nosair is my father. I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer, and a loving American mother and grade school teacher, who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me. It wasnt until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change. My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people, including the majority of Muslims, get to see. Its been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another, it doesnt take long to realize that for the most part, we all want the same things out of life. However, in every religion, in every population, youll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do. A few months prior to his arrest, he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends, he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice. He told me Id be going with him the next morning. We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range, which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI. When it was my turn to shoot, my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yards off. That day, the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyones surprise, especially mine, the entire target burst into flames. My uncle turned to the other men, and in Arabic said, Ibn abuh. Like father, like son. They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment, but it wasnt until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny. They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of. Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub level parking lot of the World Trade Centers North Tower, causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others. These were the men I looked up to. These were the men I called ammu, which means uncle. By the time I turned 19, I had already moved 20 times in my life, and that instability during my childhood didnt really provide an opportunity to make many friends. Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone, it was time to pack up and move to the next town. Being the perpetual new face in class, I was frequently the target of bullies. I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted, but as it turns out, being the quiet, chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition. So for the most part, I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games. For those reasons, my social skills were lacking, to say the least, and growing up in a bigoted household, I wasnt prepared for the real world. Id been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements, like a persons race or religion. So what opened my eyes. One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections. Through a college prep program, I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia. My particular groups focus was on youth violence, and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life, this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate. The members of our group came from many different walks of life. One day toward the end of the convention, I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish. Now, it had taken several days for this detail to come to light, and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us. I had never had a Jewish friend before, and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable. Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens, an amusement park. There, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures, and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character. Most of my life, Id been taught that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension, that all gay people were a negative influence. As chance would have it, I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there, and soon found that many were the kindest, least judgmental people I had ever met. Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others, and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated. Because of that feeling, I was able to contrast the stereotypes Id been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction. I dont know what its like to be gay, but Im well acquainted with being judged for something thats beyond my control. Then there was The Daily Show. On a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a persons race, religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of ones character. He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one. Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place, and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me. One day, I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change, and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live. She looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said, Im tired of hating people. In that instant, I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you. Zak Ebrahim is not my real name. I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life. So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger. Well, thats simple. I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way, that although I had been subjected to this violent, intolerant ideology, that I did not become fanaticized. Instead, I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism, against the bigotry. I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives. For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my fathers actions. And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof that violence isnt inherent in ones religion or race, and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father. I am not my father. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you all. Thanks a lot.

"Our society routinely makes decisions without consulting a quarter of the population. Were making choices about land use, energy production and natural resources without the ideas and experiences of the full community. The car, an inanimate object, has more say over public policy than this group of citizens. Can you guess which group Im talking about. Its children. I work in urban design, and not surprisingly, most cities are designed by adults. Urban planners, architects, developers, politicians, and occasionally, a few loud citizens. Rarely do you consider the voices of a group of four year olds, barely tall enough to reach the podium at city council chambers. But today, I want to ask you this. What would happen if we asked children to design our cities. Back in 2009, I was introduced to a small group of people who wanted to start a child friendly city initiative in Boulder, Colorado. I come from a family of civil rights advocates, and I had spent my career until that point working with low income children and families. But I had never heard of a child friendly city initiative before. So I figured its purpose would be to address some of the frustrations I had encountered as the parent of a young child. Perhaps we would advocate for more changing tables in restaurants. Or create indoor play spaces for those cold and rainy days. In other words, make the city more hospitable to children and families. It wasnt until after I committed to this project that I realized I had it all wrong. We wouldnt be designing better cities for children. Children would be designing better cities for themselves, and for the rest of us, too. Now, I bet youre skeptical about this idea. And honestly, I was, too. I mean, there must be a reason the voting age is 18. How could children possibly understand complex ideas such as the affordable housing crisis or how to develop a transportation master plan. And even if they had ideas, wouldnt they be childish. Or unreasonable. Do our cities really need a park made out of candy. Or a bridge with water cannons that fire water onto unsuspecting kayakers below. While these concerns sound legitimate, I realized that not including children in city planning was a bigger design problem. After all, shouldnt we include end users in the design process. If were building a park to be largely used by kids, then kids should have a say in the parks design. So with all of this in mind, we formed a program called Growing Up Boulder, and my job is to work with children ages zero through 18 to come up with innovative city design solutions. How do we do this, you might ask. Let me give you a real example. In 2012, the city of Boulder decided to redesign a large downtown park, known as the Civic Area. This space is bounded by a farmers market on one end, Boulder Public Library on the other end, and by Boulder Creek, which runs through the middle. The space needed a new design to better handle the creeks inevitable flash floods, restore a sense of safety to the area and support an expanded farmers market. So from 2012 through 2014, we engaged more than 200 young people in the process, ranging from preschool through high school students. Now, how did we do this. Let me explain. First, we visited children in their classrooms and presented the project, what it was, why their ideas mattered and what would happen with their recommendations. Before we could influence them, we asked children to record their ideas, based on their own lived experiences. Then we asked children to go on a field trip with us, to document what they liked and didnt like about the space, using photography. Through green picture frames, students highlighted what they liked about the space, such as college students, tubing down the creek. Then they flipped those frames over and used the red side to highlight things they didnt like, such as trash. Our sixth grade students studied the Civic Area by researching sites with similar challenges from around the world. Then, we invited the kids to combine their original ideas with their new inspiration, to synthesize solutions to improve the space. Each class invited adult planners, city council and community members into the classroom, to share and discuss their recommendations. Boulders senior urban planners stepped over blocks and stuffed animals to explore preschool students full size classroom recreation of the Civic Area. Adult planners marveled at the students ideas as they shared a park constructed out of a jelly bracelet. It was supposed to be an ice skating rink. And then, public art constructed from animal shaped plastic beads. And while this may seem ridiculous, it isnt so different from the models that architects create. Now, fast forward four years, and I am pleased to report that many of the childrens ideas are being implemented in the Civic Area. For example, there will be improved access to Boulder Creek, so kids can play safely in the water. Lighting in previously dark underpasses, so high school students can walk home safely after school at night. And separated biking and walking paths, so speeding bikers wont hit young people as they stroll by the creek. My daughter and I even skated on a new, child requested ice skating rink, last winter. So, were all of the kids ideas implemented at the Civic Area. Of course not. Democracy is a messy process. But just as a reasonable and well informed adult does not expect all of her ideas to be utilized, neither does a nine year old. Weve now been using this process for eight years, and along the way, weve found some incredible benefits to designing cities with children. First of all, kids think differently from adults. And thats a good thing. Adults think about constraints, how much time will a project take, how much money will it cost and how dangerous will it be. In other words, Are we going to get sued. Its not that these constraints arent real, but if we kill off ideas from the beginning, it limits our creativity and dampens the design process. Kids, on the other hand, think about possibilities. For kids, the sky is the limit. Literally. When we worked with middle school students to design teen friendly parks, they drew pictures of skydiving, hang gliding, and jumping from trampolines into giant foam pits. Some of this sounds far fetched, but the commonalities among the activities revealed an important story. Our adolescents wanted thrill seeking opportunities. Which makes perfect sense, given their developmental stage in life. So our task, as connectors between inspiration and reality, was to point them towards activities and equipment that actually could be installed in a park. This is exactly what parks in Australia have done, with their extensive zip lines and their 30 foot tall climbing towers. When kids dream up a space, they almost always include fun, play and movement in their designs. Now, this is not what adults prioritize. But research shows that fun, play and movement are exactly what adults need to stay healthy, too. Who wouldnt enjoy a tree house containing a little lending library and comfortable beanbag chairs for reading. Or what about a public art display that sprays paint onto a canvas each time you walk up the steps. In addition to fun and play, children value beauty in their designs. When tasked with designing dense affordable housing, kids rejected the blocks of identical, beige condominiums so many developers favor, and instead, put bright colors on everything, from housing to play equipment. They placed flowers between biking and walking paths, and placed benches along the creek, so kids could hang out with their friends and enjoy the tranquility of the water. Which leads me to nature. Children have a biological need to connect with nature, and this shows up in their designs. They want nature right in their backyards, not four blocks away. So they design communities that incorporate water, fruit trees, flowers and animals into their common spaces on site. For better or worse, this is logical, because five year olds today are rarely allowed to walk four blocks to access a park by themselves. And nature in ones immediate environment benefits everyone, since it has been shown to have restorative effects for all ages. It may come as a surprise, but we even take into consideration the desires or our littlest citizens, babies and toddlers. From toddlers, we learned that the joy of walking comes from what you discover along the way. When they evaluated the walkability of Boulders 19th Street corridor, toddlers spent long stretches exploring leaves in a ditch and sparkles in the sidewalk. They reminded us to slow down and design a path where the journey is as important as the destination. In addition to trees and plants, kids almost always include animals in their designs. Insects, birds and small mammals figure prominently into childrens pictures. Whether its because theyre closer to the ground and can see the grasshoppers better than we can, or simply because they have a greater sense of empathy for other beings, children almost always include non human species in their ideal worlds. Across the board, children are inclusive in their city planning. They design for everyone, from their grandmother in a wheelchair to the homeless woman they see sleeping in the park. Children design for living creatures, not for cars, egos or corporations. The last and perhaps most compelling discovery we made is that a city friendly to children is a city friendly to all. Bogota, Colombia mayor Enrique Penalosa observed that children are a kind of indicator species. If we can build a successful city for children, we will have a successful city for all people. Think about it. Kids cant just hop in a car and drive to the store. And most kids cant afford an expensive lunch at the nearby cafe. So if we build cities that take into the consideration their needs for alternative forms of transportation and for cheaper food venues, we meet the needs of many other populations, too. The more frequent and more affordable bus service, so desired by our youth, also supports the elderly who wish to live independently, after they can no longer drive cars. Teens recommendations for smooth, protected walking and skateboarding paths also support the person in a wheelchair who wishes to go smoothly down the path, or the parent pushing a new stroller. So to me, all of this has revealed something important. An important blind spot. If we arent including children in our planning, who else arent we including. Are we listening to people of color, immigrants, the elderly and people with disabilities, or with reduced incomes. What innovative design solutions are we overlooking, because we arent hearing the voices of the full community. We cant possibly know the needs and wants of other people without asking. That goes for kids and for everyone else. So, adults, lets stop thinking of our children as future citizens and instead, start valuing them for the citizens they are today.

society routinely makes decisions without consulting a quarter of the population. were making choices about land use energy production and natural resources without the ideas and experiences of the full community. the car anina nimate object has more say over public policy than this group of citizens. Can you guess which group. Im talking about. its children. I work in urban design. And not surprisingly, most cities are designed by adults, urban planners, architects developers, politicians. And occasionally, a few loud citizens rarely do you consider the voices of a group of four year olds barely tall enough to reach the podium at City council chambers. But today, I want to ask you this. What would happen if we asked children to design our cities. Back in 2009, I was introduced to a small group of people who wanted to start a child friendly city initiative. in Boulder. Colorado. I come from a family of civil rights advocates, and I had spent my career until that point working with low income children and families, but I had never heard of a child friendly city initiative before so I figured its purpose would be to address some of the frustrations. I had encountered as the parent of a young child, perhaps, we would advocate for more changing tables in restaurants, or create indo or play spaces for those cold and rainy days, in other words make the city more hospitable to children and families. It wasnt until after I committed to this project that I realized I had it, all wrong, we wouldnt be designing better cities for children children would be designing better cities for themselves. And for the rest of us, too. now, I bet youre skeptical about this idea. And honestly, I was too. I mean, there must be a reason the voting age is 18, How could children possibly understand complex ideas, such as the affordable housing crisis or how to develop a transportation master plan. And even if they had ideas, wouldnt they be child is horun reasonable. Do our cities really need a park made out of candy. or a bridge with water cannons that fire water onto unsuspecting Kayakers below while these concerns sound legitimate, I realized that not, including children in city. Planning was a bigger design problem. After all, shouldnt we include end users in the design process. If were building a park to be largely used by kids then kids should have a say in the parks design. So with all of this in mind, we formed a program called Growing up Boulder. And my job is to work with Child ren Ages Zero through 18 to come up with innovative city design solutions. how do we do this. You might ask. Let me give you a real example. In 2012, the city of Boulder decided to redesign a large downtown park known. as the civic areathis Space is bounded by a farmers market. On one end. Boulder, Public Library on the other end, and by boulder Creek which runs through the middle the space needed a new design to better handle the creeks, inevitable, flash floods restore a sense of safety to the area and support an expanded farmers market. So from 2012, through 2014, we engaged more than 200 young people in the process ranging from pre school through high school students. Now, How did we do this. Let me explain. First. We visited children in their classrooms and presented the project what it was why their ideas mattered. And what would happen with their recommendations before we could influence them. We asked children to record their ideas based on their own lived experiences. Then we asked children to go on a field trip with us to document what they liked and didnt like about the space using photography through green picture frames, students highlighted what they liked about the space, such as college students tubing down the creek. Then they flipped those frames over and used thered side to highlight things. They didnt like such as trash our sixth grade students studied the civic are abyresearching sites with similar challenges from around the world, Then we invited the kids to combine their original ideas with their new inspiration to synthesize solutions to improve the space. Each class invited adult planners. City Council and community members in to the classroom to share and discuss their recommendations. Boulders. Senior urban planners, stepped over blocks and stuffed animals to explore preschool students. full size classroom recreation of the civicaRea adult planners Marveled at the students ide as as they shared a park constructed out of a jellyBrace, let it was supposed to be an icesKating rink. and then public Art constructed from animal shaped plastic beads. And while this may seem ridiculous it isnt so different from the models that architects create now, fast forward four years, and I am pleased to report that many of the childrens ideas are being implemented in the civicarea, for example. There will be Improved access to boulder creeksOkIds can play safely. in the water lighting in previously dark under passes, so high school students can walk home safely after school at night and separated biking and walking paths. So speeding bikers won t hit, young people as they stroll by the Creek my daughter, and I even skated on a new child requested icesKatingrink last winter. So were all of the kids idea s implemented at the civic area, of course, not democracy Isamessy process, but just as a reasonable, and well informed adult does not expect all of her ideas to be utilized. Neither does a nine year old Weve now been using this process for eight years. And along the way weve found some incredible benefits to designing cities with children. First of all, kids think differently from adults. And thats a good thing adults. Think about constraints, how much time will a project take how much money will it cost and how dangerous will it be in other words, are we going to getsued. Its not that these constraints arent real, but if we kill off ideas from the beginning, it limits our creativity and dampens. The design process kids. On the other hand, think about possibilities for kids. The sky is the limit. literally when we worked with middle school students to design teen friendly parks. Theydrew pictures of sky diving, Hang, gliding and jumping from trampolines into giant foam pits. some of this sounds far fetched, but the commonalities among the activities revealed an important storyOur adoles cents wan ted thrill seeking opportunities, which makes perfect sense. Given their developmental stage in life. So our task as connectors between inspiration and reality was to point them. towards activities and equipment that actually could be installed in a park This is exactly what parks in Australia have done with their extensive Ziplines and their 30. Foot tall climbing towers when kids dream up a space, they almost always include fun play and movement in their designs. Now, this is not what adults prioritize. But research shows that fun play and movement are exactly what adults need to stay healthy Toow ho wouldnt enjoy a tree house containing a little lending library and comfortable Beanbag chairs, for reading, or what about a public art display that sprays paint onto a canvas each time. you walk up the steps, in addition to fun and playchildren value beauty in their designs. When tasked with designing dense affordable housing. Kids rejected the blocks of identical be igecondominiums, so many developers favor, And instead put bright colors on everything from housing to play equipment. They placed flowers between biking and walking paths and placed benches along the creeks, OK. Ids could hang out with their friends and enjoy the tranquility of the water. Which leads me to Nature children have a biological need to connect with nature. And this shows up in their designs. They want nature right in their backyards not four blocks away. So they design communities that in corporate water fruit trees, flowers and animals into their common Spaceson site, For better. Or worse. This is logical. Because five year olds today are rarely allowed to walk four blocks to access a park by themselves, and nature in ones immediate Environment benefits, everyone. since it has been shown to have restorative effects for all ages. It may come as a surprise. but we even take into consideration the desires or our littlest citizens babies and toddlers from toddlers, we learned that the joy of Walking comes from what you discover along the way when they evaluated the walkability of boulders 19th Street corridor toddlers spent long stretches exploring leaves in AditchandsParkles. In the side walk. They reminded us to slow down and design a path where the journey is as important as the destination. In addition to trees and plants kids, almost always include animals in their designs insects, birds, and small mammals, figure prominently into childrens pictures, whether its because theyre closer to the ground, and can see the grasshoppers better than we can or simply because they have a greater sense of empathy for other beings. children almost always include non human species in their ideal worlds across the board, children are inclusive in their city planning. They design for everyone from their grandmother in a wheelchair to the homeless woman they see sleeping in the park. children design for living creatures, not for cars egos, or corporations the last and perhaps most compelling discovery. We made is that a city friendly to children is a city friendly to all Bogota. Colombia mayor Enrique Pena Losa observed that children are a kind of indicat or species. If we can build a successful city for children, we will have a successful city for all people Think about it. Kids cant justhop in a car and drive to the store, and most kids cantafford an expensive lunchat the near by cafe. So if we build cities that take into the consideration their needs for alternative forms of transportation and for cheaperfood venues. we meet the needs of many other populations too, the more frequent and more affOrdable bus service, so de sired byour youth also supports the elderly, who wish to live independently after they can no longer drive carsteens recommendations for smooth, Protected walking, and skateboarding Paths also support the person in a wheelchair, who wishes to go smoothly down, the path or the parent pushing a new stroller, so to me, All of this has revealed something important, an important blind spot. If we arent including children in our planning, Who else arent we, including are we listening to people of color immigrants the elderly and people with disabilities or with reduced in comes what innovative design solutions are we over looking because we arent hearing the voices of the full community, we cant possibly know the needs and wants of other people without asking that goes for kids and for everyone else so adults. lets stop thinking of our children as future citizens, and instead start, valuing them for the citizens they are today, because our children are designing the cities that will make us happier and healthier. Cities filled with nature play movement social connection and beauty, Children are designing the cities. We all want to live in. thank you,"
"Americas favorite pie is. Audience. Apple. Apple. Of course it is. How do we know it. Because of data. You look at supermarket sales. You look at supermarket sales of 30 centimeter pies that are frozen, and apple wins, no contest. The majority of the sales are apple. But then supermarkets started selling smaller, 11 centimeter pies, and suddenly, apple fell to fourth or fifth place. Why. What happened. Okay, think about it. When you buy a 30 centimeter pie, the whole family has to agree, and apple is everyones second favorite. But when you buy an individual 11 centimeter pie, you can buy the one that you want. You can get your first choice. You have more data. You can see something that you couldnt see when you only had smaller amounts of it. Now, the point here is that more data doesnt just let us see more, more of the same thing we were looking at. More data allows us to see new. It allows us to see better. It allows us to see different. In this case, it allows us to see what Americas favorite pie is, not apple. Now, you probably all have heard the term big data. In fact, youre probably sick of hearing the term big data. It is true that there is a lot of hype around the term, and that is very unfortunate, because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance. In the past, we used to look at small data and think about what it would mean to try to understand the world, and now we have a lot more of it, more than we ever could before. What we find is that when we have a large body of data, we can fundamentally do things that we couldnt do when we only had smaller amounts. Big data is important, and big data is new, and when you think about it, the only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges, to feed people, supply them with medical care, supply them with energy, electricity, and to make sure theyre not burnt to a crisp because of global warming, is because of the effective use of data. So what is new about big data. What is the big deal. Well, to answer that question, lets think about what information looked like, physically looked like in the past. In 1908, on the island of Crete, archaeologists discovered a clay disc. They dated it from 2000 B.C., so its 4,000 years old. Now, theres inscriptions on this disc, but we actually dont know what it means. Its a complete mystery, but the point is that this is what information used to look like 4,000 years ago. This is how society stored and transmitted information. Now, society hasnt advanced all that much. We still store information on discs, but now we can store a lot more information, more than ever before. Searching it is easier. Copying it easier. Sharing it is easier. Processing it is easier. And what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first collected the data. In this respect, the data has gone from a stock to a flow, from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic. There is, if you will, a liquidity to information. The disc that was discovered off of Crete thats 4,000 years old, is heavy, it doesnt store a lot of information, and that information is unchangeable. By contrast, all of the files that Edward Snowden took from the National Security Agency in the United States fits on a memory stick the size of a fingernail, and it can be shared at the speed of light. More data. More. Now, one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that weve always collected information on, but another reason why is were taking things that have always been informational but have never been rendered into a data format and we are putting it into data. Think, for example, the question of location. Take, for example, Martin Luther. If we wanted to know in the 1500s where Martin Luther was, we would have to follow him at all times, maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell, and record it, but now think about what it looks like today. You know that somewhere, probably in a telecommunications carriers database, there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry that records your information of where youve been at all times. If you have a cell phone, and that cell phone has GPS, but even if it doesnt have GPS, it can record your information. In this respect, location has been datafied. Now think, for example, of the issue of posture, the way that you are all sitting right now, the way that you sit, the way that you sit, the way that you sit. Its all different, and its a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back, and if I were to put sensors, maybe 100 sensors into all of your chairs right now, I could create an index thats fairly unique to you, sort of like a fingerprint, but its not your finger. So what could we do with this. Researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti theft device in cars. The idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel, tries to stream off, but the car recognizes that a non approved driver is behind the wheel, and maybe the engine just stops, unless you type in a password into the dashboard to say, Hey, I have authorization to drive. Great. What if every single car in Europe had this technology in it. What could we do then. Maybe, if we aggregated the data, maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds. And then what we will have datafied is driver fatigue, and the service would be when the car senses that the person slumps into that position, automatically knows, hey, set an internal alarm that would vibrate the steering wheel, honk inside to say, Hey, wake up, pay more attention to the road. These are the sorts of things we can do when we datafy more aspects of our lives. So what is the value of big data. Well, think about it. You have more information. You can do things that you couldnt do before. One of the most impressive areas where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, which itself is a branch of computer science. The general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what do do, we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself. And it will help you understand it by seeing its origins. In the 1950s, a computer scientist at IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers, so he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer. He played. He won. He played. He won. He played. He won, because the computer only knew what a legal move was. Arthur Samuel knew something else. Arthur Samuel knew strategy. So he wrote a small sub program alongside it operating in the background, and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. He plays the computer. He wins. And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself. It plays itself. It collects more data. It collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction. And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it, and he loses, and he plays it, and he loses, and he plays it, and he loses, and Arthur Samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it. And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere. How do you think we have self driving cars. Are we any better off as a society enshrining all the rules of the road into software. No. Memory is cheaper. No. Algorithms are faster. No. Processors are better. No. All of those things matter, but thats not why. Its because we changed the nature of the problem. We changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say, Heres a lot of data around the vehicle. You figure it out. You figure it out that that is a traffic light, that that traffic light is red and not green, that that means that you need to stop and not go forward. Machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online, search engines, Amazons personalization algorithm, computer translation, voice recognition systems. Researchers recently have looked at the question of biopsies, cancerous biopsies, and theyve asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not, and sure enough, when you throw the data at it, through a machine learning algorithm, the machine was able to identify the 12 telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous. The problem. The medical literature only knew nine of them. Three of the traits were ones that people didnt need to look for, but that the machine spotted. Now, there are dark sides to big data as well. It will improve our lives, but there are problems that we need to be conscious of, and the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions, that the police may use big data for their purposes, a little bit like Minority Report. Now, its a term called predictive policing, or algorithmic criminology, and the idea is that if we take a lot of data, for example where past crimes have been, we know where to send the patrols. That makes sense, but the problem, of course, is that its not simply going to stop on location data, its going to go down to the level of the individual. Why dont we use data about the persons high school transcript. Maybe we should use the fact that theyre unemployed or not, their credit score, their web surfing behavior, whether theyre up late at night. Their Fitbit, when its able to identify biochemistries, will show that they have aggressive thoughts. We may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do, and we may be held accountable before weve actually acted. Privacy was the central challenge in a small data era. In the big data age, the challenge will be safeguarding free will, moral choice, human volition, human agency. There is another problem. Big data is going to steal our jobs. Big data and algorithms are going to challenge white collar, professional knowledge work in the 21st century in the same way that factory automation and the assembly line challenged blue collar labor in the 20th century. Think about a lab technician who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether its cancerous or not. The person went to university. The person buys property. He or she votes. He or she is a stakeholder in society. And that persons job, as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person, is going to find that their jobs are radically changed or actually completely eliminated. Now, we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short, temporary period of dislocation, and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live, the Industrial Revolution, because thats precisely what happened. But we forget something in that analysis. There are some categories of jobs that simply get eliminated and never come back. The Industrial Revolution wasnt very good if you were a horse. So were going to need to be careful and take big data and adjust it for our needs, our very human needs. We have to be the master of this technology, not its servant. We are just at the outset of the big data era, and honestly, we are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect. Its not just a problem for the National Security Agency. Businesses collect lots of data, and they misuse it too, and we need to get better at this, and this will take time. Its a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire. This is a tool, but this is a tool that, unless were careful, will burn us. Big data is going to transform how we live, how we work and how we think. It is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of satisfaction and hope and happiness and health, but in the past, weve often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen the T, the technology, the hardware, because thats what was physical. We now need to recast our gaze at the I, the information, which is less apparent, but in some ways a lot more important. Humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect, as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it, and thats why big data is a big deal.

favorite pieis. Audience. Apple. Apple, Of course, it is. How do we know it because of data, you look at supermarket Sales, you look at supermarket. Sales of 30 centimeterpies that are frozen and apple wins no contest, the majority of the sales are apple. But then supermarkets started selling smaller 11 centimeter pies. And suddenly apple fell to fourthor fifth place. Why what happened. Okay. Think about it, when you buy a 30 centimeter pie, the whole family has to agree and apple is everyones second favorite, but when you buy an individual 11 centimeter pie, you can buy the one that you want. You can get your first choice you have more data, you can see something that you couldnt see when you only had smaller amounts of it. Now, the point here is that more data doesnt just let us see more more of the same thing. We were looking at more data allows us to see new it allows us to see better. It allows us to see different. in this case. it allows us to see what Americas favoritepie is not. Apple. Now, you probably all have heard the term big data. In fact, youre probably sick of hearing the term big data. It is true that there is a lot of hype around the term, and that is very unfortunate, because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance. in the past. We used to look at small data, and think about what it would mean to try to understand the world. And now we have a lot more of it. More than we ever could before. what we find is that when we have a large body of data, we can fundamentally do things that we couldnt do when we only had smaller amounts. big data is important. and big data Is new. And when you think about it, the only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges to feed people supply them with medical care supply them with energy, electricity, and to make sure theyre not burnt to a crisp because of global warming is because of the effective use of data. So what is new about big data. What is the big deal. Well, to answer that question, Lets think about what information looked like physically looked like in the past in 1908 on the island of Crete archaeologists discovered a clay disc. they dated it from 2,000 BC. So its 4,000 years old now. Theres inscriptions on this disc, but we actually dont know what it means. Its a complete mystery. But the point is that this is what information used to look like 4,000 years ago. This is how society stored and transmitted information. Now, society hasnt advanced all that much. We still sto re information on discs. But now we can store a lot more information more than ever before. Searching it is easier, copying. It easier sharing. it is easier processing. It is easier. And what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined. When we first collected the data in this respect, the data has gone from a stock to aflow from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic, there is if you will, Aliquidity to information the disc that was discovered off of crete. Thats 4,000 years old is heavy, It doesnt store a lot of information. And that information is unchangeable. By contrast, all of the files that Edward Snowdentook from the national Security agency in the United States fits on a memory stick the size of a fingernail, And it can be shared at the speed o f light more data more. Now, one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that weve always collected information on but another reason. Why is were taking things that have always been informational, but have never been rendered into a data format, and we are putting it in to data think, For example, the question of location. Take, For example, Martin Luther if we wanted to know in the 1500s, where Martin Luther was we would have to follow him at all times, maybe with a featheryquill and an inkwell and record it. But now think about what it looks like today. You know that somewhere probably in a telecommunications carriers, database. There is a spread sheet, or at least a databaseentry that records your information of where youve been at all times, If you have a cell phone, and that cell phone has GPS. But even if it doesnt have GPS, it can record your information in this respect location has been datafied. Now. Think, for example, of the issue of posture, the way that you are all sitting right now, The way that yousit, the way that yousit, the way that yousit, its all different. And its a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back. And if I were to put sensors, maybe 100 sensors into all of your chairs right now, I could create an index thats fairly unique to you. sort of like a fingerprint, but its not your finger. So, what could we do with this researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti thefT device in cars. The idea is that the car jackers, its behind the wheeltries to stream off. but the car recognizes that a nonapproved driver is behind the wheel, and maybe the engine just stops unless you type in a password into the dashboard to say, Hey, I have authorization to drive great, what if every single car in Europe had this technology, in it, what could we do. Then. Maybe if we aggregated the data, maybe we could identify tell tale signs that best predict that a car accident Is going to take place in the next five seconds. And then what we will have. Data fied is driver fatigue, and the service would be when the car senses that the persons lumps into that position, automatically knows hey set an internal alarm. that would vibrate, the steering wheelhonk inside to say, hey, wake up paymore attention to the road. These are the sorts of things we can do when wed atafy more aspects of our lives. So what is the value of big data. Well, think about it. You have more information. you can do things that you couldnt do before. One of the most impressive are as where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, which itself is a branch of computer science, the general idea is that instead of instructing a computer, what do do we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself, and it will help you understand it by seeing its origins. in the 1950s, a computer scientist at IBM named Arthurs, A muel liked to play checkers. So he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer. He played. He won he played. he won he played he won because the computer only knew whatalegal move was. Arthur Sa muel knew somethingElse. Arthur Sa muel knew strategy. so he wrote a small sub program, alongside it operating in the background, and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board. After every move, he plays the computer he wins. he plays the computer, he wins. he plays the computer, he wins and the NarthurSAmuel leaves the computer to play itself. It plays itself. It collects more data. It collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction, and the n arthurSA muel goes back to the computer. And he plays it. And he loses. And he plays it. And he loses. And he plays it. And he loses and Arthur. Samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability inatask that he taught it. And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere. How do you think we have self driving Cars. are. We any better off as a society enshrining all the rules of the road into software. no memory is cheaper, No, algorithms are faster, No processors are better. No all of those things matter. But thats not why its because we changed the nature of the problem. We changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to o. Vertly and explicitly explainto the computer how to drive to one in which we say, Heres a lot of data around the vehicle you figure it out, You figure it out That that is a trafficlight that that traffic light is red, and not green that that means that you need to stop and not go forward Machine. learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do on line, search engines, Amazons. Personalization algorithm computer translation voice recognition systems. researchers recently have looked at the question of biopsies, cancerous biopsies, and theyve asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not. And sure enough, when you throw the data at it through a machine learning algorithm, The machine was able to identify the 12 tell talesigns that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous the problem the medical literature only knew nine of them. Three of the traits were ones that people didnt need to look for but that the machine spotted now, there are dark sides to big data as well. It will improve our lives. But there are problems that we need to be conscious of. And the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions that the police may use big data for their purposes a little bit like minority report Now. Its a term called predictive policing, or algorithmic criminology, and the idea is that if we take a lot of data, for example, where past crimes have been we know where to send the patrols that makes sense. But the problem, of course is that its not simply going to stop on location data. Its going to go down to the level of the individual. Why dont we use data about the persons high school transcript. Maybe we should use the fact that theyre unemployed or not their credit s core their websurfing behavior. whether theyre up late at night their fitbit when its able to identify biochemistries will show that they have aggressive thoughts, we may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do. And we may be held accountable before weve actually acted privacy was the central challenge in a small data era in the big data age. The challenge will be safe. Guarding free will moral choice. Humanvolition, human agency. There is another problem. big data is going to steal our jobs. big data and algorithms are going to challenge white collar professional knowledge work in the 21st century in the same way that factory automation and the assembly line challenged blue collar labor in the 20th century. Think about a lab technician, Who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether its cancerous or, not. The person went to university, the person buys property, he or she votes. He or she is as takeholder in society. And that persons job as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person is going to find that their jobs are radically changed or actually completely eliminated Now, we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short temporary period of dislocation. And that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live, the Industrial Revolution, because thats precisely what happened. But we forget something in that analysis. There are some categories of jobs that simply get eliminated and never come back. The Industrial Revolution wasnt very good. If you were a horse. So were going to need to be careful and take big data, and adjust it for our needs, our very human needs. We have to be the master of this technology not its servant. We are just at the outset of the big data era. and honestly, we are not very good at handling all the data that we can Now collect. its not just a problem for the national Security agency businesses collect lots of data. and they misuse it, too, and we need to get better at this. and this will take time. Its a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire. this is a tool, But this is a tool that unless were careful Will burnus. big data is going to trans form how we live how we work and how we think it is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of satisfaction, and hope and happiness and health. But in the past, weve often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen thet the technology the hardware, because thats what was physical. We now need torecast our gaze at the I, the information, which is less apparent, but in some ways, a lot more important, humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect as part of our timeless quest. To understand the world and our place in it. And thats Why Big data is a big deal,"
"Who remembers this infamous Styrofoam container. Well, it sure changed me, it changed my company, and it started a revelatory journey about how adversaries can be your best allies. You know, back in the late 80s, this Big Mac clamshell was the symbol of a garbage crisis. People were really angry. For example, thousands of students, young students around the globe were sending letters, blaming McDonalds, because we were using millions of these at that time. Now, no one at McDonalds knew anything about environmentally friendly packaging, including me. The last 10 years, I was in charge of logistics and truck drivers. Then out of nowhere, my boss comes to me and says, Hey, we want you to save this clamshell for the company and lead the effort to reduce waste within McDonalds. I looked at him and I asked him, What is polystyrene. But it all sounded intriguing to me because it brought me back to my roots. You see, I grew up in the late 60s, early 70s, in a time of huge social upheaval in the United States. And I was really in tune with the protests, the sit ins, the anti Vietnam sentiment, and I really felt there was a need to question authority. But as I went into university, I realized that Im not going to make a living doing this. And that whole movement had subsided, and my activist spirit went dormant. And I needed to make a living, so I got involved in the business world. So, now these students against pollution, who were sending those protest letters to McDonalds, they reminded me of myself 20 years ago. Theyre questioning authority. But now, Im the man. Im the corporate suit. Im the one representing authority. And this new thing was emerging called corporate social responsibility, later corporate sustainability, and now I had a chance to make a difference. So the beginning of this journey started when McDonalds agreed to a partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund. They were an NGO that was founded with the principle of sue the bastards. So Im thinking, what are they thinking about me and my team. When I first met Richard Denison, hes the senior scientist for EDF, I was very apprehensive. I thought hes a tree hugger, and Im thinking he thinks all I care about is the money. So we wanted the EDF team to give us real world solutions. So we did the logical thing. We had them flip burgers in our restaurants. So you have to imagine Richard, who, by the way, is a PhD in physics, and there he is, hes trying to dress a quarter pounder, and youre supposed to have two squirts of ketchup, one mustard, three pickles and an onion, go on to the next one, youve got to be so fast. And you know what. He couldnt get it right all day long. And he was frustrated. And I was so impressed, because he was trying to understand our business. Now, the EDF team, they thought reusables were the holy grail for our business. Me and my team thought, reusables. Too much space, theyd make a mess, they would slow us down. But we didnt reject the idea. We went to the restaurant they chose outside DC, we went to the back room. The dishwasher wasnt working properly, its spitting out dirty dishes. The kitchen area is dirty and grimy. And compared to their experience at McDonalds thats clean and organized, they could see the stark difference. We also sat in a restaurant at McDonalds, all day long, and watched the customers eating in. Their behavior. Ends up that many customers left with the food, they left with the beverage. And EDF came to their own conclusion that reusables wouldnt work for us. But they did have a lot of ideas that did work. And we never would have thought of them by ourselves, without the EDF team. My favorite was switching from the white carry out bag to the brown bag. We had been using the white bag. Its virgin material, its made from chlorine bleaching chemicals, and they said, use an unbleached bag, no chemicals. Its made from recycled content, mostly recycled shipping corrugated boxes. Ends up that the bag is stronger, the fiber is stronger, it didnt cost us more money. It was win win. Another idea they had was that we could reduce our napkin by one inch. And make it from recycled office paper. Im thinking, one inch, no big deal. We did it, it reduced waste by three million pounds a year. Sixteen thousand trees saved. What was really cool is we changed that bright white napkin, because the recycled content became gray and speckled. And we made that look, you know, in tune, in vogue with customers. So, I came to really enjoy the time working with the EDF team. We had many dinners, late night discussions, we went to a ball game together. We became friends. And thats when I learned a life lesson. That these NGO crusaders, theyre really no different than me. They care, they have passion, were just not different. So, we had a six month partnership that ended up producing a 42 point waste reduction action plan. To reduce, reuse, recycle. We measured it during the decade of the 90s, and over 10 years we reduced 300 million pounds of waste. Now, if youre wondering about that polystyrene clamshell, yeah, we ditched it. And luckily, I still had a job. And this partnership was so successful that we went on to recycle the idea to work with critics. Collaborate with them on solutions that could work for society and for business. But could this idea of collaborating work with the most contrarian folks. And on issues that are, you know, not within our direct control. Like animal rights. Now, animal rights, obviously they dont want animals used for meat. McDonalds, probably the biggest purchaser of meat in the food service industry. So theres a natural conflict there. But I thought it would be best to go visit and learn from the most vociferous and vigilant critics we had at that time, which were Henry Spira, head of Animal Rights International, and Peter Singer, who wrote the book Animal Liberation, which is considered the modern treatise about animal rights. You know, I read Peters book to prepare, I tried to get into his mindset, and I have to admit, it was tough, Im not becoming a vegan, my company wasnt going that way. But I really thought we could learn a lot. And so I set up a breakfast meeting in New York City. And I remember sitting down, getting ready, and I decided Im not going to order my favorite, which is you know, bacon and sausage and eggs. And Im just going to stick to the pastries. But I have to admit, I was waiting for the adversarial discussion to happen. And it never did. Henry and Peter were just gracious, they were caring, they were smart, they asked good questions. I told them about how working on animal welfare is very tough for McDonalds because our direct suppliers, they only make meat patties. The animals are three or four steps removed from our influence. And they were very empathetic. And while we were so directly opposed in terms of the missions of our organizations, I felt that I had learned a lot. And best of all, they gave me a terrific recommendation. And that is, they said, You should work with Dr. Temple Grandin. Now, I didnt know her at the time. But I tell you, shes the most renowned expert, then and now, on animal behavior. And she knows how animals move and how they should react in facilities. So I end up meeting her, and shes the very best type of critic, in a sense that she just loves the animals, wants to protect them, but she also understands the reality of the meat business. And Ill always remember, I had never been to a slaughterhouse in my life, and so I go with her for my first trip. I didnt know what to expect. And we find that the animal handlers have electric prods in their hands, and are basically zapping almost every animal in the facility. Were both appalled, shes jumping up and down, youd have to know her, shes saying, This cant be, this isnt right, we could use flags, we could use plastic bags, we could redesign the corrals for natural behavior. Well I set up Temple with our suppliers to set up standards and guidelines. And ways to measure her ideas of implementing animal welfare. We did this for the next two to five years. And it all got integrated, it all got enforced. By the way, two of McDonalds suppliers lost business because they didnt meet our standards. And best of all, all these standards ended up scaling to the entire industry. And no more zapping of those animals. Now, what about issues that were blamed for elsewhere. Like deforestation. You know, on that issue, I always thought, policy makers and government, thats their role. Never thought it would end up in my lap. But I remember in early April 2006, I opened up my Blackberry, and Im reading about Greenpeace campaigners showing up in the UK by the dozens, dressed as chickens, having breakfast at McDonalds and chaining themselves to the chairs and tables. So they got a lot of attention, including mine. And I was wondering if the report that they had just released, it was called Eating Up the Amazon. And by the way, soy is a key ingredient for chicken feed, and thats the connection to McDonalds. So I called my trusted friends at the World Wildlife Fund, I called Conservation International, and I soon learned that the Greenpeace report was accurate. So I gathered internal support, and Ill always remember, next day, after that campaign, I called them up, and I said, We agree with you. And I said, How about working together. So three days later, miraculously, four people from McDonalds, four people from Greenpeace, were meeting in the London Heathrow airport. And I have to say, the first hour was shaky, it wasnt a whole lot of trust in the room. But it seemed like everything came together, because each of us wanted to save the Amazon. And during our discussions, you couldnt really tell, I dont think, who was from Greenpeace and who was from McDonalds. So one of the best things we did is we traveled with them for nine days on a trip through the Amazon, on the Greenpeace airplane, on the Greenpeace boat. And Ill always remember, imagine traveling hundreds of miles west of Manaus, the capital city of the Amazon. And its so pristine beauty, theres no man made structures, theres no roads, not one wire, not one house. You would travel east of Manaus and you would see the blatant rainforest destruction. So this very unlikely collaboration produced outstanding results. By working together, we recruited over a dozen other retailers and suppliers for the same cause. And by the way, within three months, a moratorium on these clear cutting practices was announced by the industry. And Greenpeace themselves declared it as a spectacular drop in deforestation and its been in effect ever since. Now, you think these types of collaborations that Ive described would be commonplace today. But theyre not. When organizations are battered, the common response is to deny and push back, put out some sort of lame statement and no progress is made at all. I say the alternative is really powerful. I mean, its not going to fix every problem, and theres more to do for sure, but this idea of working with critics and trying to do more good for society that actually is good for business, believe me, its possible. But it starts with the idea that you need to assume the best intentions of your critics. Just like you have the best intentions. And then secondly, you need to look past a lot of these tactics. I admit, I did not like a lot of the tactics used on my company. But instead, focus on what the truth is, whats the right thing to do, whats the science, whats the facts. And lastly, you know, I would say, give the critics the keys. Show them the back room. Bring them there, dont hide the details, because if you want allies and support, you need to be open and transparent.

remembers this infamous Styrofoam container. Wellit sure changed me, it changed my company, and it started a revelatory journey about how adversaries can beyour best allies. You know, back in the late 80s. This big Mac Clam, shell was the symbol of a garbage crisis, People were really angry. For example, thousands of students young students around the globe. were sending letters Blaming McDonalds because we were using millions of these at that time. Now, no one at McDonalds knew anything about environmentally friendly packaging, including me the last 10 years, I was in charge of logistics and truck drivers, then out of no, where, my boss comes to me and says, Hey, we want you to save this clam shell for the company and lead the effort to reduce waste Within McDonalds. I looked at him, and I asked him, what is polysty rene. But it all sounded intriguing to me, because it brought me back to my Roots you see I grew up in the late 60s, early 70s, in a time of huge social upheaval in the United States. And I was really in tune with the protests, the sitins, the anti vietn am sentiment, and I really felt there was a need to question authority, But as I went into university, I realized that Im not going to make a living doing this and that whole movement had subsided, and my activist Spirit went dormant, and I needed to make a living. So I got involved in the business world. So Now these students against pollution who were sending those protest letters to McDonalds. They reminded me of myself 20 years ago. Theyre questioning authority. But now Im the man Im the corporate suit. Im the onerepresenting authority. And this new thing was emerging called corporate social responsibility later, corporate sustainability, and now I had a chance to make a difference. So the beginning of this journey started when McDonalds agreed to a partner ship with the Environmental Defense. Fund, they were an NGO that was founded with the principle of sue the bastards. So Im thinking, What are they thinking about Me. And my team. When I first met Richard Denison, Hes the senior scientist foredFI was very apprehensive. I thought hes a tree hugger. And Im thinking, he think s allicare about is the money, so we wanted theedfteam to give us real world solutions. So we did the logical thing. We had them F lip burgers in our restaurants. So you have to imagine Richard who, by the way is a PhD in physics. And there he is. Hes trying to dress a quarter pounder, and youre supposed to have two squirts of ketch up. One mustard three pickles and anonion go on to the next one. Youve got to be so fast. And you know what. He couldnt get it right. All day long, and he was frustrated. And I was so impressed because he was trying to understand our business now the Edfteam, they thought Reusables were the Holy Grail for our business me and my team though, Treusables too much space, theyd make a mess. they would slow us down, but we didnt reject. The idea. We went to the restaurant. they chose out sideDC. we. Went to the backroom thedishwasher wasnt working properly, its spitting out dirty dishes, the kitchen. Area is Dirty and grimy. and compared to their experience at McDonalds. thats clean and organized they could see the stark difference. We also sat in a restaurant at MCDonalds all day long, and watched the customers eating in their behavior ends up that many customers left with the food. they left with the beverage. and eDf came to their own conclusionthat reusables wouldnt work for us, but they did have a lot of ideas that did work, and we never would have thought of the m by ourselves without the edfteAm. My favorite was switching from the White Carry out bag to the brown bag we had been using the white bagits virgin material. Its made from chlorine, bleaching chemicals, and they said Use an unbleached bagno chemicals. its made from recycled content. Mostly recycled shipping corrugated boxes ends up that the bag is stronger. The fiber is stronger. it didnt cost us more. Money it was winwin another idea. they had was that we could reduce our napkin by one inch and make it from recycled office paper. Im thinking one inch No big deal. We did it. it reduced waste by three million pounds a year. Sixteen thousand trees saved. What was really cool is we changed that bright. White napkin because the recycled content became gray and speckled, and we made that look, you know, in tune in vogue with customers. So I came to really enjoy the time working with the EdfTeam, we had many dinners latenight discussions. We went to a ball game together. We became friends. And thats when I learned a life less on that thesEngo crusaders, theyre really no different than me. they care. They have passion. Were just not different. So we had a six month partnership that ended up producing a 42 point waste reduction action plan to reduce reuse recycle. we measured it during the decade of the 90s. And over 10 years, we reduced 300 million pounds of waste. Now, If youre wondering about that polystyrene clamshell. Yeah, weditched It. And Luckily, I still had a job. And this partnership was so successful that we went on to recycle. The idea to work with critics collaborate with the monsolutions that could work for society and for business. But could this idea of collaborating work with the most contrarian folks and on issues that are, you know, not within our direct control like animal Rights now animal rights. Obviously, they dont want animals used for me at McDonalds probably the biggest pur chaser of meat in the food service industry. So theres a natural conflict there, but I thought it would be best to go visit and learn from the most vociferous and vigilant critics. We had at that time, which were henryspirahead of animal rights international. And Peter Singer, who wrote the book animal liberation, which is considered, the modern treatise about animal rights. You know, I read Peters book to prepare, I tried to get into his mindsEt. And I have to admit, it was tough. Im not becoming Avegan. my company wasnt going that way. But I really thought we could learn a lot. And so I set up a breakfast meeting in New York City, and I remember sitting down getting ready And I decided Im not going to order. my favorite, which is, you know, bacon and sausage and eggs. And Im just going to stick to the pastries. but I have to admit, I was waiting for the adversarial discussion to happen. And it never did. Henry. And peter were just gracious. they were caring. They were smart. They asked good questions. I told them about how working on animal welfare is very tough for McDonalds because our direct suppliers. They only make me at patties. The animals are three or four steps removed from our influence. And they were very empathetic. And while we were so directly opposed in terms of themissions of our organizations, I felt that I had learned a lot. And best of all, they gave me a terrific recommendation. And that is, they said, you should work with Dr. Temple Grandin Now, I didnt know her at the time, but I tell you shes the most renowned expert then and now on animal behavior, and she knows how animals move and how they should react in facilities. So I end up meeting her and shes the very best type of critic, in a sense that she just loves, The animals wants to protect them, but she also understands the reality of the m eat business, and Ill always remember. I had never been to aslaughter house in my life, and so I go with her for my first trip. I didnt know what to expect. And we find that the animal handlers have electric prods in their hands and are basically zapping. almost every animal in the facility. Were both appalled shes jumping up and down. youd have to know her. Shes saying, This cant be. this isnt right We could use flags we could use plastic bags, we could redesign the corrals for natural behavior. Well, ise t up temple with our suppliers to set up standards and guide lines and ways to measure her ideas of implementing animal welfare. We did this for the next two to five years. And it all got integrated it all gotenforced. by the way, two of McDonalds suppliers lost business, because they didnt meet our standards. And best of all, all these standards, ended up scaling to the entire industry, and no more zapping of those animals. Now what about issues that were blamed for elsewhere. Like deforestation. you know, on that issue. I always thought policy makers and government thats their role never though t it would end up in my lap, but I remember in early April 2006, I opened up my blackberry. And Im reading about Green Peace campaigners showing up in the U.K. by the dozens dressed as chickens, having breakfast at McDonalds and chaining themselves to the chairs and tables, so they got a lot of attention including mine. And I was wondering if the report that they had just released. it was called eating up the Amazon. And by the way, soy is a key ingredient for chicken feed, and thats the connection to McDonalds. So I called my trusted friends at the World Wildlife. Fundi called Conservation International. and I soon learned that the green peace report was accurate. So I gathered internal support, and Ill always remember next day after that campaign. I called them up, and I said, We agree with you. And I said, How about working together. So three days later, miraculously four people from McDonalds. Four people from Green peace were meeting in the Lond on, He athrow airport. And I have to say, the first hour was shaky. It wasnt a whole lot of trust in the room, but it seemed like everything came together. Because each of us wanted to save the Amazon. And during our discussions. You couldnt really tell. I dont think who was from Green Peace and who was from McDonalds. So one of the best things we did is we traveled with them for nine days. On a trip through the Amazon on the Greenpeace airplane on the green peace boat, and ill always remember, imagine traveling hundreds of miles, West of manaus the capital city of the Amazon. And its so pristine beauty. Theres noman made structures. Theres no roads, not one wire, not one house. You would trave l east of manaus and you would see the blatant rainforest destruction. So this very unlikely collaboration produced out standing results by working together. we re cruited over a dozenother retailers and suppliers for the same cause, And by the way, within three months amoratorium on these clear cutting practices was announced by the industry and Green peace themselves declared it as a spectacular drop in deforestation, and its been in effect ever since. Now you think these types of collaborations that Ive described would be common place today, but theyre not When organizations are battered. the common response is to deny and push back put out somesorto f lame statement, and no progress is made a t all. I say, The alternative is really powerful. I mean, its not going to fix every problem, and theres more to do for sure. But this idea of working with critics and trying to do more good for society that actually is good for business. Believe me, its possible, but it starts with the idea that you need to assume the best intentions of your critics, just like you have the best intentions. And then secondly, you need to look past a lot of these tactics, I admit, I did not like a lot of the tactics used on my company. But instead focus on what the truth is, whats the right thing to do. Whats the science. Whats the facts. And lastly, You know, I would say give the critics, the keys show them the backroom bring them there, dont hide the details, because if you want allies and support you need to be open and transparent. Now whether youre a corporate suit, whether youre a tree hugger I say, the next time youre criticize. d reachout. listen learn youll become better your organization will become better. and you might make some good friends along the way thank you,"
"There we were, souls and bodies packed into a Texas church on the last night of our lives. Packed into a room just like this, but with creaky wooden pews draped in worn down red fabric, with an organ to my left and a choir at my back and a baptism pool built into the wall behind them. A room like this, nonetheless. With the same great feelings of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms and the same people in the back not paying attention. This was December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I knew it. I had turned 12 that year and had reached the age of accountability. And once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was that Jesus would return as soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done, I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly. So I went to church as often as I could. I listened for silence as anxiously as one might listen for noise, trying to be sure that the Lord hadnt pulled a fast one on me and decided to come back early. And just in case he did, I built a backup plan, by reading the Left Behind books that were all the rage at the time. And I found in their pages that if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight, I had another shot. All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast, fight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself. It would be hard, but I knew I could do it. But planning time was over now. It was 11 50pm. We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar because he wanted to be praying when midnight struck. So every faction of the congregation took its place. The choir stayed in the choir stand, the deacons and their wives, or the Baptist Bourgeoisie as I like to call them, took first position in front of the altar. You see, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section. And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly, these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of East Texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs. Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me. They had waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show to come on Channel 8 every day at 4 oclock. And as she made her way to the altar, I snuck right in behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heaven. And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer, I might go right on with her. So I held on and I closed my eyes to listen, to wait. And the prayers got louder. And the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still. And the organ rolled on in to add the dirge. And the heat came on to add to the sweat. And my hand gripped firmer, so I wouldnt be the one left in the field. My eyes clenched tighter so I wouldnt see the wheat being separated from the chaff. And then a voice rang out above us, Amen. It was over. I looked at the clock. It was after midnight. I looked at the elder believers whose savior had not come, who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now. But I was upset on their behalf. They had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled, and I had gone right along with them. I had prayed their prayers, I had yielded not to temptation as best I could. I had dipped my head not once, but twice in that snot inducing baptism pool. I had believed. Now what. I got home just in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium as it rolled in around the world. It struck me that it would have been strange anyway, for Jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones. And this made me feel even more ridiculous, hurt, really. But there on that night, I did not stop believing. I just believed a new thing, that it was possible not to believe. It was possible the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong. And now, where there was once a mountain of certitude, there was, running right down to its foundation, a spring of doubt, a spring that promised rivers. I can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night in that church when my savior did not come for me, when the thing I believed most certainly turned out to be, if not a lie, then not quite the truth. And even though most of you prepared for Y2K in a very different way, Im convinced that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the dawn of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come. And I held out my hand, reaching for something to believe in. I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, with the faith that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known, the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen. But when I found myself back home one winter break, with my face planted in the floor, my hands tied behind my back and a burglars gun pressed to my head, I knew that even the best education couldnt save me. I held on when I showed up at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008. So hopeful, that I called home to inform my family that wed never be poor again. But as I witnessed this temple of finance come crashing down before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldnt save me. I held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young staffer, who had heard a voice call out from Illinois, saying, Its been a long time coming, but in this election, change has come to America. But as the Congress ground to a halt and the country ripped at the seams and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke, I knew that even the political second coming could not save me. I had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time of success, and money, and power. But over and over again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead. And from that graveyard, I began the search once more, not because I was brave, but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die. So I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca, Harvard Business School, this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer. No, I knew thered be more work to do. The work began in the dark corner of a crowded party, in the late night of an early, miserable Cambridge winter, when three friends and I asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time, What if we took a road trip. We didnt know whered we go or how wed get there, but we knew we had to do it. Because all our lives we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere, and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country. So even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great and the proof too thin, we went on anyhow. We went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013, through the cow pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, through the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose their bottom line. And having been trained at the West Point of capitalism, this struck us as a revolutionary idea. And this idea spread, growing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America, a movement that landed me here on this stage today. It spread because we found a great hunger in our generation for purpose, for meaning. It spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the nooks and crannies of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and who needed a little help. But if Im being honest, it also spread because I fought to spread it. There was no length to which I would not go to preach this gospel, to get more people to believe that we could bind the wounds of a broken country, one social business at a time. But it was this journey of evangelism that led me to the rather different gospel that Ive come to share with you today. It began one evening almost a year ago at the Museum of Natural History in New York City, at a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School. Under a full size replica of a whale, I sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds. There was pride in a room where net worth and assets under management surpassed half a trillion dollars. We looked over all that we had made, and it was good. But it just so happened, two days later, I had to travel up the road to Harlem, where I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day. All of them lived below the poverty line. Many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter. Some of them came to Tonys program, called Harlem Grown, to get the only meal they had each day. Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown with money from his pension, after 20 years as a cab driver. He told me that he didnt give himself a salary, because despite success, the program struggled for resources. He told me that he would take any help that he could get. And I was there as that help. But as I left Tony, I felt the sting and salt of tears welling up in my eyes. I felt the weight of revelation that I could sit in one room on one night, where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars, and another room, two days later, just 50 blocks up the road, where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day. And it wasnt the glaring inequality that made me want to cry, it wasnt the thought of hungry, homeless kids, it wasnt rage toward the one percent or pity toward the 99. No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant. I realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps, even if they didnt have any boots, that my organization stood in for all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward, that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated. And the shame of that, that shame washed over me like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium again and again and again. I had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled. But this time, the false savior was me. You see, Ive come a long way from that altar on the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people spoke in tongues and saw suffering as a necessary act of God and took a text to be infallible truth. Yes, Ive come so far that Im right back where I started. Because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of disbelief, no, we believe today just as much as any time that came before. Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brene Brown or Tony Robbins. We may believe in the bible of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review. We may believe most deeply when we worship right here at the church of TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe. We speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems. We see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god, we take the text of technological progress to be infallible truth. And we hardly realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one brick, because we fear it might shake our whole foundation. But if you are disturbed by the unconscionable things that we have come to accept, then it must be questioning time. So I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line. I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today, in fact. I have and I offer a gospel of doubt. The gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing, it asks that you believe a new thing, that it is possible not to believe. It is possible the answers we have are wrong, it is possible the questions themselves are wrong. Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong. Because it raises the question, Why. With all the power that we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so bad. This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization, MBAs Across America, out of business. We have shed our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission. This doubt compels me to renounce the role of savior that some have placed on me, because our time is too short and our odds are too long to wait for second comings, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here. And this doubt, it fuels me, it gives me hope that when our troubles overwhelm us, when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise, when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith, no, it will be our humble doubt that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives and of our world and lets us raise our voice to whisper or to shout or to say simply, very simply, There must be another way.

we were souls and bodies packed into a Texas church on the last night of our lives, packed into a room just like this. But with creaky woodenpews draped In worn down red fabric with an organto my left and a choir at my back and a Baptism pool, built into the wall behind them a room like this none, theless with the same great feelings of suspense, tHe same deep hopes for salvation the same sweat in the palms and the same people in the back not paying attention. This was December 3.1, 1999, the night of the second coming of christ and the end of the world, as I knew it. I had turned 12 that year and had reached the age of accountability. And once I stopped complaining about how unfair, it was that Jesus would return as soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done. I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly. So I went to churchas often as I could. I listened for silence, as anxiously as one might listen. For Noise, trying to be sure that the Lord hadnt pulled a fast one on me and decided to come back early. And just in case he did, I built a backup plan by reading the left behind books that we re all therage at the time, And I found in their pages that if I was not taken in the raptureat midnight, I had another shot all I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast fight off demons plagues, and the anti Christ himself, it would be hard. but I knew I could do it. but planning time was over. Now. It was 11, 50p.m. we had 10 minutes left and my pastor called us out of the Pews and downto the altar. Because he wanted to be praying when midnightstruck. So every faction of the congregation took its place. The Choir, stayed in the choirsT and the deacons and their wives. or the baptist bourgEoisie as, I like to call them took first position in front of the altar. You see in America, even the second coming of Christ has avip section. And right behind the baptist bourgEoisie were the elderly. These men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns in. The cotton fields of east Texas, and whose skin seemed to be burntacreaseless noble brown, just like the clay of East, Texas and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of East. Texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs. Yes. These men and women were the stars of the show. for me. They had waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world. And just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah winfreys how to Come on channel 8 every day at 4 o clock. And as she made her way to the altar, I snuck right in behind her. Because I knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heaven, and I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer I might go right on with her. So I held on. And I closed my eyes to listen to wait, and the prayers got louder and the shouts of response to the call of the prayer, went up, higher even still and the organ rolled on in to add the dirge, and the he at came on to add to the sweat and my hand gripped firmer. So I wouldnt be the one left in the field my eyes clenched tighter, so, I wouldnt see the wheat. being separated from the chaff, and then a voicerang out aboveu samen, it was over. I looked at the clock it was aftermidnight, I looked at the elder believers, whose savior had not come who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment who had believed too much. And for too long to start doubting now, but I was upset on their behalf. They had been dupedhood winked bamboozled, and I had gone right, along with them. I had prayed their prayers. I had yielded not to temptation. As best I could I had dipped my head, not once but twice in thats not inducing Baptism pool. I had believed. Now what I got home Just in time to turn on the television and watch. Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, as itrolled in around the world. It struck me that it would have been strange anyway for Jesus to come back again. And again, based on the different time zones, And this made me feel even more ridiculoushurt really, but there on that night, I did not stop believing. I just believed a new thing that it was possible. not to believe it was possible the answers, I had were wrong that the questions themselves were wrong. and now where there was once a mountain of Certitude, There was running right down to its foundation aspring of doubt a spring that promised Rivers, I can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night. In that church, when my savi or did not come for me when the thing I believed most certainly turned out to be, if notalie, thennot quite the truth. And even though most of you prepared for Y2 k in a very different way. Im convinced that you are here, because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the dawn of this new century, since. My mother left. And my father, stayed away, and my Lord refused to come, and I held out my hand reaching for something to believe in. I held on. when I arrived at Yale at 18 with the faith that my journey from oak Cliff, Texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges. I had known The broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen, But when I found myself back home onewinter break with my face planted in the floor. my handstied behind my back and a burglars gun pressed to my head, I knew that even the best education couldnt save me. I held on when I showed up at Lehman brothers as an intern in 2008, so hopeful that I called home to inform my family that wed never be poor again. But As I witnessed this Temple of financecome crashing down before my eyes. I knew that even the best job couldnt save me. I held on when I showed up in Washington DC., as a young st affer who had heard a voice call out from Illino is saying, Its been a long time coming. But in this election change has come to America, but as the Congress ground to a halt, and the country ripped at the seams and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke. I knew that even the political second, coming could not save me. I had knelt faith fully at the altar of the American dream, praying to the gods of my time of success and money and power, but over and over again, midnightstruck. and I opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead. And from that graveyard, I began the search once more, not because I was brave. But because I knew that I would either believe or I would die. So I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca Harvard business school this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer no I knew Thered be more work to do. The work began in the dark corner of a crowded party in the late night of a nearly miserable. Cambridge winter, when three friends, and I asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time. What if we took a road trip. We didnt know wheredwe go or how wedget there, But we knew we had to do it, because all our lives we yearned as jack, kerouac wrote to sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country. So, even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great, and the proof toothin we went on any how we went on 8,000 miles across America, in the summer of 2013, through the cow pastures of montana through the desolation of Detroit through the swamps of New Orleans where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses. That made purpose their bottom line and having been trained at the West point of capitalism this struck us as a revolutionary idea. And this idea spread growing into a nonprofit called MBas across America A movement that landed me here on this stage today it spread, because we found a great hunger in our generation for purpose for meaning it spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the nooks and Crannies of America, who were creating jobs and changing lives, and who needed a little help. But if Im being honest it also spread, because if ought to spread it. There was no length. To which I would not go to preach. This gospel to get more people to believe that we could bind the wounds of a broken country, one social business at a time. But it was this journey of Evangelism. that led me to the rather different. Gospel That Ive come to share with you today. It began one evening, almost a year ago, at the Museum of Natural history in New York City, a t agala foralumni of Harvard Business school under a full size replica of a whale. I sat with the titans of our time, As they celebrated their peers. And their good deeds, there was pride in a room, where networthand as sets. Under management surpassed, half a trillion dollars. We looked over all that we had made. And it was good, but it just so happened Two days later, I had to travel up the road to harlem where I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had onCe been a va cant lot listening To a man named Tony Tell me of the kids that showed up there every day. All of them lived below the poverty line, many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter. Some of them came to TonyS program called Harlem grown to get the only meal they had each day. Tony told me that he started Harlem grown with money from his pension, after 20 years as a cabdriver, he told me that he didnt give himself a salary. Because despite success, the program struggled for resource, s. He told me that he would take any help that he could get. And I was thereas that help, But as I left, tony, I felt thesting and salt of tears welling up in my eyes, I felt the weight of revelation that I could sit in one room on one night, where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars, and another room. Twodays later just 50 blocks up the road where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day, and it wasnt the glaring inequality that made me want to cry. it wasnt the thought of hungry homeless kids. It wasnt rage toward the one percentor pity toward. The 99. No. I was disturbed, because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant, I realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps even if they didnt have any boots that my organizationstood in for all the structural systemic help that never went to Harlemorap palachia, or the lower 9thward that my voicestood in forall those voices that seemed toounlearned toounwashed tooun accommodated, and the shame of that that shame washed over me, like the shame of sitting in front of the television watching Peter. Jennings announce the new Millennium again and again. And again. I had been duped hood winked bamboozled, But This time, the false savior was me. You see, Ive come a long way from that Altar on the night, I thought the world would end from a world where people spoke in tongues and saw suffering as a necessary act of God and took a text to be infallible, truth. Yes. Ive come so far that Im right back, where I started, because it simply is not true to say that. we live in an age of disbelief. No we believe today just as much as any time that came before some of us may believe in the prophecy of brene Brown, or Tony robbins, we may believe in the Bible of The New Yorker, or the Harvard Business Review, we may believe most deeply. When we worship right here at the church of tED, But we desperately want to believe we need to believe we speak. In the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems, We see suffering, as a necessary act of the capitalism, that is our god. We take the text of technological progress to be infallible truth, and we hardly realize the human price, we pay when we fail to question one brick, because we fear. It might shake our whole foundation. But if you are disturbed by the Unconscionable things that we have come to accept then it must be questioning time. So I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line, I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today. In fact, I have and I ofFeragospel of doubt the Gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing it asks that you believe a new thing that it is possible not to believe it is possible. The answers we have are wrong. It is possible. The questions themselves are wrong. Yes. the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we on this stage in this room are wrong, because it raises the question. Why with all the power that we hold in our hands. Why are people still suffering so bad. This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization mbas across America out of business, We have shed our staff and closed our doors, And we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission. This doubt compels me to renounce the role of savi or that Some have placed on me. because our time is, too short, and our odds are too long to wait for second comings. when the truth is that there will be no miracles here, and this doubt. it fuels me. it gives me hope that when our troubles overwhelmus when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds, it will not be our blind, faith. No, it will be our humble doubt that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives, and of our world, and lets us raise our voice to whisper or to shoutor to say simply, very simply. There must be another way. Thank you."
"I was 17 when I chose my career. I was standing outside on a hot summer night in Florida and just a few miles from the ocean. I was waiting for a miracle to happen. That summer, I was privileged to work as an intern at NASAs Kennedy Space Center, and the miracle I was waiting for was the launch of the Columbia Space Shuttle carrying the Chandra X Ray Observatory, a telescope that would allow scientists to peer into the edge of black holes. The entire sky filled with light. And it was as if it was daytime in the middle of the night. Soon, we could feel the rumble of the engines vibrating in our chests. And it wasnt a miracle, it was the combined effort of a team of thousands of people who worked together to make was seemed impossible a reality. And I wanted to join that team. So I decided to apply to a university where I could study aerospace engineering. And the following year, I started at MIT in my engineering training and joined a student project building space robots. And everything was going as I planned, except I was confused about something important. Now, my confusion arose in my summer breaks. I traveled to a school in Kenya, and there I volunteered with girls ages five to 17, giving them lessons in English and math and science. And they taught me songs in Swahili. And mostly, I just spent time getting to know the girls, enjoying their presence. And I saw that these girls and the leaders in their community, they were overcoming important barriers to allow these girls to have the best possible chances in life. And I wanted to join that team. I wanted to be part of a team that would help break down barriers and improve the lives of girls around the world. But I was worried that studying aerospace engineering wasnt the most useful. I was worried this team in Kenya couldnt use the technology I was learning about space. But thankfully, I still learned that I was wrong. I came back and interned at NASA again, and this time, a mentor taught me that countries like Kenya had been using space technology for decades to improve the lives in their own countries. And then I knew that I could have a career in space and in development. This idea is not new. In fact, in 1967, the nations of the world came together to write the Outer Space Treaty. This treaty made a bold statement, saying, The exploration and use of outer space should be carried on for the benefit of all peoples, irrespective of their level of economic or scientific development. We have not truly lived up to this ideal, although people have worked for decades to make this a reality. Forces such as colonialism and racism and gender inequality have actually excluded many people from the benefits of space and caused us to believe that space is for the few or the rich or elite. But we cannot afford this attitude, because the world is engaged in a vital mission to improve life for everyone. Our road map for this mission comes from the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. All the member states of the United Nations have agreed that these are priorities between now and 2030. These goals give us our key moments and opportunities of our time, opportunities to end extreme poverty, to insure that everyone has access to food and clean water. We must pursue these goals as a global community. And technology from space supports sustainable development. In fact, there are six space services that can help us pursue the Sustainable Development Goals. Over the next few minutes, lets explore these six services, and see examples of just a few of the goals they help support. You ready. OK. Communication satellites provide access to phone and internet service to almost any location on Earth. This is particularly important during times of disaster recovery. When Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines, the local communication networks needed to be repaired, and teams brought in inflatable communication antennas that could link to satellites. This was useful during the time of repair and recovery. Positioning satellites tell us where we are by telling us where they are. Scientists can use this technology to track endangered wildlife. This turtle has been fitted with a system that allows it to receive location information from positioning satellites, and they send the location information to scientists via communication satellites. Scientists can use this knowledge to then make better policies and help determine how to keep these animals alive. Earth observation satellites. They tell us whats going on in our environment. Right now, there are about 150 satellites operated by over 60 government agencies, and these are just those observing the Earth. And meanwhile, companies are adding to this list. Most of the governments provide the data from the satellites for free online. Some of these satellites provide images like this, that show what you would see from a camera. This is an image showing agricultural land in Kansas. However, the majority of the Earth observation satellites dont take pictures at all. They take measurements. And they combine these measurements with complex computer models and make beautiful, global visualizations such as this one, showing the ocean currents and the temperature of the ocean, globally. Or we can look at the salt and smoke and dust in the atmosphere, or the rainfall and snowfall, globally, as well as the annual cycle of vegetation on land and in the ocean. Now, scientists can take this information about the rainfall and the vegetation and use it to understand what areas on Earth are in danger of a famine or a drought and provide that information to aid organizations so they can be prepared with food aid before the hunger becomes severe. In space, we have an orbiting laboratory on the International Space Station. The vehicle and everything inside are in a form of free fall around the Earth, and they dont experience the effect of gravity. And because of this, we call it microgravity. When astronauts are in the microgravity environment, their bodies react as if theyre aging rapidly. Their bones and muscles weaken, and their cardiovascular system and their immune system change. As scientists study how to keep astronauts healthy in space, we can take the exercises and techniques we use for astronauts and transfer them to people on Earth to improve our health here. Often, as we develop technology for astronauts and exploration or for spacecraft, we can also transfer those inventions to improve life on Earth. Heres one of my favorites. Its a water filtration system, and a key component of it is based on the technology to filter wastewater on the space station. Its now being used around the world. Space is also an infinite source of inspiration, through education, through research and astronomy and that age old experience of stargazing. Now, countries around the world are engaging in advancing their own development by increasing their local knowledge of engineering and science and space. Lets meet some of the worlds newest satellite engineers. This is Elyka Abello, from Venezuela. Elyka is training as a satellite engineer as part of her national satellite program in Venezuela. She has designed a software tool that allows her team to better design the power systems for engineering. This is Adel Castillo Duran, from the Philippines. Adel is both a meteorologist and a satellite engineer, and she uses data from satellites in her weather forecasting. And finally, meet Hala. Hala is from the Sudan, and as she was studying electrical engineering as an undergraduate in Khartoum, she and several students decided to build their own satellite. And later, Hala earned a scholarship to study satellite engineering at the graduate level. These stories that Ive shared with you all illustrate that space truly is useful for sustainable development for the benefit of all peoples. But we have more work to do, because there are still barriers that exclude people from space and limit the impact of this technology. For many people, Earth observation data is complex. And satellite communication services are too expensive. And microgravity research just appears to be inaccessible. This is what motivates my work as a professor at MITs Media Lab. Ive recently founded a new research group called Space Enabled. We are working to tear down these barriers that limit the benefits of space. And were also going to develop the future applications that will continue to contribute to sustainable development. Well keep on this work until we can truly say that space is for the benefit of all peoples, and we are all space enabled. Thank you.

was 17, when I chose my career. I was standing outside on a hot summernight in Florida. and just a few miles from the ocean. I was waiting for a miracle to happen. That summer, I was privileged to work as an intern at NaSas Kennedy Space Center, and the miracle I was waiting for was the launch of the Columbia Space shuttle carrying the Chand r ax ray observatory, A telescope. That would allow scientists to peer into the edge of black holes. the entire Skyfilled with light, And it was as if it was day time in the middle of the night, soon we could feel the rumble of the engines vibrating in our chests, and it wasnt a miracle. it was the combined effort of a team of thousands of people who worked together to make was seemed impossible a reality. And I wanted to join that Team, So I decided to apply to a university where I could study aerospace engineering. And the following year, I started at MiT in my engineering training and joined a student Project building space, robots, and everything was going as I planned except I was confused about something important. Now, my confusion arose in my summer breaks I traveled to a school in Kenya, and there I vol unteered with girlsages five to 17 giving them lessons in English and math and science, and they taught me songs in Swahili, and mostly I just spent time getting to know the girls enjoying their presence. And I saw that these girls and the leaders in their community, they were overcoming important barriers to allow these girls to have the best possible chances in life. And I wanted to join that Team. I wanted to be part of a team. That would help break down barriers and improve the lives of girls around the world, but I was worried. That studying aerospace engineering wasnt the most useful. I was worried. This team in Kenya couldnt use the technology. I was learning about space. But thankfully, I stIll learned that I was wrong. I came back and interned at NASA again, and this time amentor taught me that countries like Kenya had been using space technology for decades to improve the lives in their own countries. And then I knew that I could have a career in space and in development. This idea is not new. In fact, in 1967, the Nations of the World came to gether to write the Outer space Treaty. this treaty made a bold statement, saying the exploration and use of outer space should be carried on for the benefit of all peoples irrespective of their level of economic or scientific development. we have not truly lived up to this ideal, although people have worked for decades to make this a reality forces such as colonialism and racism and gender inequality have actually excluded many people from the benefits of space and caused us to believe that space is for the few orthe rich or elite, But we cannot afford this attitude, because the world is engaged in a vital mission to improve life for everyone. our roadmap for this mission comes from the 17 Sustainable Development goals of the United Nations, all the member States of the United Nations have agreed that these are priorities between now and 2030, these goals give us our key moments and opportunities of our time. opportunities to end extreme poverty to insure that everyone has access to food and clean water. We must pursue these goals as a global community and technology from space supports sustainable development. In fact, there are six space services that can help us pursue the Sustainable development goals over the next few minutes, lets explore these six services and see examples of just a few of the goals. they help support. You re adYOK. Communication, satellites, provide AcceS s to phone and Internet service to almost any location on earth. This is particularly important during times of disaster recovery. When typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines, the local communication networks needed to berepaired and teams brought in inflatable communication antennas that could link to satellites, this was useful during the time of repair and recovery positioning satellites tell us, where we are by telling us where they are. Scientists can use this technology to track endangered wildlife. This turtle has been fitted with a system that allows it to receive location information, from positioning satellites, and they send the location information to scientists, via communication satellites, scientists can use this knowledge to then make better policies and help determine how to keep these animals alive Earth observation satellites, They tell us whats going on in our environment. Right. now, there are about 150 satellites operated by over 60 government agencies, and these are just those observing the Earth. And mean while, companies are adding to this list. most of the governments provide the data from the satellites for free online, some of these satellites provide images like this that show what you would see from a camera. This is an image showing agricultural landin Kansas. However, the majority of the Earth observation satellites dont take pictures at all. They take measurements, and they combine these measurements with complex computer models and make beautiful global visualizations, such as this one, showing the ocean currents and the temperature of the ocean globally. or we can look at the salt and smoke and dust in the atmosphere, or the rainFall and snowFall globally, as well as the annual cycle of vegetation on land and in the ocean. Now, scientists can take this information about the rainfall. And the vegetation and use it to understand what a reas on Earth are indanger of a famine or a drought and provide that information to aid organizations so they can be prepared with food aid before. The hunger becomes severe in space, we have an orbiting laboratory on the International Space Station, the vehicle and everything inside are in a form of free fall around the Earth, and they dont experience the effect of gravity. and because of this we call it micro gravity. When astronauts are in the microgravity environment their bodies react as if theyre aging, rapidly. their bones and muscles Weaken and their cardiovascular system and their immune system, change as scientists study how to keep astronauts healthy in space, we can take the exercises and techniques we use for astronauts and transfer them to people on Earth to improve our health here often as we develop technology for astronauts and exploration or for spacecraft. we can also transfer those inventions to improve life on Earth. Heres one of my favorite s. Its a water filtration system and a key component of it is based on the technology to filter waste water on the space station. Its now being used around the world space is also an infinite source of inspiration through education through research and astronomy, And that age old experience of stargazing now countries around the world are engaging in advancing their own development by increasing their local knowledge of engineering and science and space. Lets meet some of the worlds newest satellite engineers, thisisely Kaa bello From Venezuelaely Ka is training as a satellite engineer as part of her National satellite program in Venezuela. She has designed a software tool that allows her team to better design, The power systems for engineering, this is a delcastilloduran from the Philippines. a delis bothameteorologist and a satellite engineer, and she uses data from satellites in her weather forecasting. And finally, me, Et Ha. lAHaLa is from the Sudan, and as she was studying electrical engineering as an undergraduate inKhar toum, SHe and several students decided to build their own satellite and later hala earned a scholarship to study Satellite engineering at the graduate level, these stories that Ive shared with you All illustrate that space truly is useful for sustainable development for the benefit of all peoples. But we have more work to do because there are still barriers that exclude people from space and limit. the impact of this technology. For many people earth observationdata is complex and satellite communication. Services are too, expensive and microgravity research just appears to be inaccessible. This is what motivates my work. As a professor. At MIts medialab. Ive recently, founded a new research group called Space enabled We are working to tear down these barriers that limit the benefits of space. And were also going to develop the future applications that will continue to contribute to sustainable development. Well, keep on this work until we can truly say that space is for the benefit of all peoples, and we are all space enabled. Thank you"
"In two weeks time, thats the ninth anniversary of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed Jeopardy set. I mean, nine years is a long time. And given Jeopardys average demographics, I think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead. But not all, a few are still alive. Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever. And when I do, its as a bit of a know it all. I think that ship has sailed, its too late for me. For better or for worse, thats what Im going to be known as, as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff. And I cant complain about this. I feel like that was always sort of my destiny, although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet. If nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager, it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirks middle name. And as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know it all for many years. But if you go further back, if you look at it, its all there. I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad with whatever great fact I had just read about, Haleys comet or giant squids or the size of the worlds biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was. I now have a 10 year old of my own whos exactly the same. And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work. And I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows. I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979 because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school, that I was also going to miss Hollywood Squares and Family Feud. I was going to miss my game shows. And later, in the mid 80s, when Jeopardy came back on the air, I remember running home from school every day to watch the show. It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house. And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working, where there was only one English language TV channel. There was Armed Forces TV, and if you didnt speak Korean, thats what you were watching. So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch Jeopardy. I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid. I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the 80s and holding my own, back when that was a fad. Theres a weird sense of mastery you get when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad dont know. You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didnt know. And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power, the right fact deployed at exactly the right place. I never had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career path, that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex game show contestant. And so I sold out way too young. I didnt try to figure out what one does with that. I studied computers because I heard that was the thing, and I became a computer programmer, not an especially good one, not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on Jeopardy in 2004. But thats what I was doing. And it made it doubly ironic, my computer background, a few years later, I think 2009 or so, when I got another phone call from Jeopardy saying, Its early days yet, but IBM tells us they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at Jeopardy. Are you up for this. This was the first Id heard of it. And of course I said yes, for several reasons. One, because playing Jeopardy is a great time. Its fun. Its the most fun you can have with your pants on. And I would do it for nothing. I dont think they know that, luckily, but I would go back and play for Arbys coupons. I just love Jeopardy, and I always have. And second of all, because Im a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future. People playing computers on game shows was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future, and now I could be on the stage with it. I was not going to say no. The third reason I said yes is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win. I had taken some artificial intelligence classes. I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on Jeopardy. People dont realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a Jeopardy clue in a natural language like English and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings, unpack the meaning of the clue. The kind of thing that a three or four year old human, little kid could do, very hard for a computer. And I thought, well this is going to be childs play. Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species. But as the years went on, as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this, I started to get occasional updates from them, and I started to get a little more worried. I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph. It was a scatter chart showing performance on Jeopardy, tens of thousands of dots representing Jeopardy champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of, I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess, clues responded to, versus the accuracy of those answers. So theres a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to. And at first, it was very low. There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena. But then you see the line start to go up. And its getting very close to what they call the winners cloud. And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color. And thought, what are these. The black dots in the upper right represent 74 time Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings. And I saw this line coming for me. And I realized, this is it. This is what it looks like when the future comes for you. Its not the Terminators gun sight, its a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do, the only thing that makes you special, the thing youre best at. And when the game eventually happened about a year later, it was very different than the Jeopardy games Id been used to. We were not playing in L.A. on the regular Jeopardy set. Watson does not travel. Watsons actually huge. Its thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory, trillions of bytes of memory. We got to walk through his climate controlled server room. The only other Jeopardy contestant to this day Ive ever been inside. And so Watson does not travel. You must come to it, you must make the pilgrimage. So me and the other human player wound up at this secret IBM research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County to play the computer. And we realized right away that the computer had a big home court advantage. There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage. Like youre going to play the Chicago Bulls, and theres the thing in the middle of their court. And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers cheering on their little darling, having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up, and holding up Go Watson signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right. I think guys had W A T S O N written on their bellies in grease paint. If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters W A T S O N written on their gut, its an unpleasant sight. But they were right. They were exactly right. I dont want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR, but Watson won handily. And I remember standing there behind the podium as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking. It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer. And you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick. And I remember thinking, this is it. I felt obsolete. I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the 80s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line. I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers. And it hasnt been the last. If you watch the news, youll see occasionally, and I see this all the time, that pharmacists now, theres a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist. And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because theres software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions. You dont need human assistants for that anymore. I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score from a baseball or football game and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game and was commenting on it. And obviously these new technologies cant do as clever or creative a job as the humans theyre replacing, but theyre faster, and crucially, theyre much, much cheaper. So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be. Ive read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies, well enter a new golden age of leisure when well all have time for the things we really love because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren. Ive heard other people say quite the opposite, that this is yet another tier of the middle class thats having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous, something that we should worry about. Im not an economist myself. All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work. And it was friggin demoralizing. It was terrible. Heres the one thing that I was ever good at, and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do the same thing. They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV, and Im sorry, Ken. We dont need you anymore. And it made me think, what does this mean, if were going to be able to start outsourcing, not just lower unimportant brain functions. Im sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends phone numbers. And suddenly there was a machine that did that, and now we dont need to remember that anymore. I have read that theres now actually evidence that the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships, physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like GPS, because were not exercising our sense of direction anymore. Were just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard. And as a result, a part of our brain thats supposed to do that kind of stuff gets smaller and dumber. And it made me think, what happens when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are. Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that. Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less. As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know, this was a terrifying idea to me. The more I thought about it, I realized, no, its still important. The things we know are still important. I came to believe there were two advantages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says, Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second. Theres an advantage of volume, and theres an advantage of time. The advantage of volume, first, just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays. Theres so much information out there. Being a Renaissance man or woman, thats something that was only possible in the Renaissance. Now its really not possible to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor. Theres just too much. They say that the scope of human information is now doubling every 18 months or so, the sum total of human information. That means between now and late 2014, we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes, as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together. Its doubling every 18 months now. This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts. A decision like where do I go to school. What should I major in. Who do I vote for. Do I take this job or that one. These are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts. If we have those facts at our mental fingertips, were going to be able to make informed decisions. If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up, we may be in trouble. According to a National Geographic survey I just saw, somewhere along the lines of 80 percent of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map. If you cant do that first step, are you really going to look up the other thousand facts youre going to need to know to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy. Quite probably not. At some point youre just going to be like, You know what. Theres too much to know. Screw it. And youll make a less informed decision. The other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips. I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith. She was a 10 year old girl from Surrey, England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand. She runs up to them on the beach one morning and says, Mom, Dad, weve got to get off the beach. And they say, What do you mean. We just got here. And she said, In Mr. Kearneys geography class last month, he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea and you see the waves churning way out there, thats the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach. What would you do if your 10 year old daughter came up to you with this. Her parents thought about it, and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her. They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel, and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily, because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami, the day after Christmas, 2004, that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean. But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach, because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before. Now when facts come in handy like that, I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact, one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time, normally something thats easier to see on game shows than in real life. But in this case it happened in real life. And it happens in real life all the time. Its not always a tsunami, often its a social situation. Its a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge. You say where youre from, and I say, Oh, yeah. Or your alma mater or your job, and I know just a little something about it, enough to get the ball rolling. People love that shared connection that gets created when somebody knows something about you. Its like they took the time to get to know you before you even met. Thats often the advantage of time. And its not effective if you say, Well, hold on. Youre from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up. Oh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo. That doesnt work. Thats just annoying. The great 18th century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson, Samuel Parr once said, Its always better to know a thing than not to know it. And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, its probably that. I have always believed that the things we know, that knowledge is an absolute good, that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are, as individuals and as a species. I dont know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete. I dont want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty, so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together. I dont want to be the last trivia know it all sitting on a mountain somewhere, reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of Simpsons episodes and the lyrics of Abba songs. I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices, to our search engines and our smartphones. In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think, things dont always end well. Those movies are never about beautiful utopias. Its always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in 2001. Things always go terribly wrong. And I feel like were sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in. This is a question of leadership, because it becomes a question of who leads the future. On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than its ever been in human history, where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips. And on the other hand, we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and weve all decided its not important what we know anymore, that knowledge isnt valuable because its all out there in the cloud, and why would we ever bother learning anything new. Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in. And we can all make that choice. We make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn, who dont just say, Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over, I dont have to learn anymore, or Thank goodness I have my diploma. Im done learning for a lifetime. I dont have to learn new things anymore. No, every day we should be striving to learn something new. We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us. Thats where the people you see on Jeopardy come from. These know it alls, theyre not Rainman style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book. Ive met a lot of them. For the most part, they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything, thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject. We can live in one of these two worlds. We can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know, continue to be the thing that makes us special, or a world in which weve outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.

two weeks time, thats the ninth anniversary of the day. I first stepped out on to thathallowed Jeopardyset. I mean, nine years is a long time and given Jeopardys average demographics. I think what that means is, most of the people who saw me on thats how are now dead, but not all, a few are st Ill alive. Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever and when I do its as a bit of a know it all. I think thatship has sailed its too late for me, for better or for worse. Thats what Im going to be known as as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff. And I cant complain about this I feel like that was always sort of my destiny, although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the Triviacloset. If nothing else, you realize very quickly. As a teenager, it is not a hit with girls to know. captain Kirks, middle name. And As a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know it all for many years. But if you go furtherback, if you look at it. Its all there. I was the kind of kid who was always bugging. Mom and dad with whatever great fact, I had just read about haleys come tor giant squids or the size of the worlds biggest pumpk in pie or whatever, it was I now have a 10 year old of my own whos exactly the same and I know how deeply annoying it IssoK arma does work. And I loved game shows fascinated with game shows, I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back In 1979, because it had just hit me as badly. as I wanted to go to school that I was also going to miss Hollywood squares and family feudI was going to miss. My game s, hows and later in the mid 80s when Jeopardy came back on the airiremember running home from school every day to watch the show. It was my favorite show even before it paid for my house, and we lived over seas. We lived in South Korea, where my dad was working where there was only one English language, TV channel, There was armed forces. TV, and if you didnt speak Korean, thats what you were watching so me and all my friends would run home every day and watch Jeopardy. I was always that kind of obsessed Trivia kid. I remember being able to play trivial pursuit against my parents, back in the 80s and holding my own back. When that was a fad. Theres a weird sense of mastery you get when you know, some bit of Boomer Trivia that mom and dad dont know you know some Beatles factoid that dad didnt know and you think, Ahhah, Knowledge really is power, the right fact deployed at exactly the right place. I n ever had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career Path. that thought, You could major in trivia or bea profession Al Ex games how contestant, and so I sold out way, too young I didnt try to figure out what one does with that. I studied computers because I heard that was the thing, and I became a computer programmer, not an especially good one not an especially happyone at the time when I was first on Jeopardy in 2004, but thats what I was doing. And it made it doubly ironic my computer background. A few years later, I think 2009 or So, when I got another phone call from Jeopardy saying, Its early days yet, but iBM tells us they want to build a super computer to be at you at Jeopardy. Are you up for this. This was the first Id heard of it. And of course, I said, Yes for several reasons. One, Because playing Jeopardy is a great time. Its fun. Its the most fun, you can have with your pantson. And I would do it for nothing. I dont think they know that. luckily, but I would go back and play for arbys coupons. I just love jeopardy and I always have. And second of all, because I m a nerdy guy, and this seemed like the future people playing computer son game shows was the kind of thingI always imagined would happen in the future, and now I could be on the stage with it. I was not going to say, No, the third reas on. I said, Yes is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win. I had taken some artificial intelligence classes. I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on Jeopardy. People dont realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a jeo pardy clue in a natural language, like English and understand all the double meanings the puns the red her ringSunpack. the meaning of the clue the kind of thing that a three or four year old human little kid could do very hard for a computer. And I thought, Well, this is going to be childs play. Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species. But as the years went on as IbM started throwing money and manpower and process or speed at this I started to get occasional updates from them, and I started to get a little more worried. I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph. it was a scatter chart showing performance on jeopardy. Tens of thousands of dots representing Jeopardy champions up at the top with their performance plotteDon number of I was going to say questions. answered but answers questionEd, I guess clues responded to versus the accuracy of those answers. So theres a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to. And at first, it was very low. There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena. but then you see the line start to go up, and its getting very close to what they call the winner s Cloud. And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots, some black dots that were a different color and thought, what are these the black dots in the upper right represent 74 time JeoPardy Champion. Ken jennings, and I saw this linecoming for me. And I realized this is it. This is what it looks like when the future comes for you. Its not the terminators gunsight. Its a little linecoming closer and closer to the thing, you can do. The only thing that makes you special the thing youre best at and when the game eventually happened. About a year later, It was very different than the Jeopardy games. Id been used to we were not playing in L.a on the regular Jeopardy. set Watson does not travel watsons actually huge. its thousands of process or sater abyte of memory. Trillions of bytes of memory, We got to walk through his climate controlled server room the only other jeopardy contestant to this day Ive ever been inside. And So watson does not travel, you must come to it. You must make the pilgrimage. so me and the other human player wound up at this secret, IBM research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County to play the computer, and we realized right away, that the computer had a big home court advantage. There was a big watson lo go in the middle of the stage, like youre going to play the ChicaGo bulls. And theres the thing in the middle of their court, and the crowd was full of IBMVPs and programmers, cheering on their little darling, having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up and holding up go. Wats on signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one, right. I think guys had Watson written on their bellies, in grease paint, if you can imagine computer programmers with the letters Wats on written on their gut. Its an unpleasant sight, but they were right. They were exactly Right. I dont want to spoil it if you still have this sitting on your DVR. but watson won handily, and I remember standing there behind the podium as I could hear that little insectoid thumb. c. licking. it had a robot thumb That was clicking on the buzzer, and you could hear that little tick, ticktick tick. And I remember thinking, This is it. I felt obsolete, I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the 80s, seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line. I felt like quizshow contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers, and it hasnt been the last if you watch the news youll see occasionally, and I see this all the time that pharmacists now theres a machine that Can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist. And a lot of law. Firms are getting rid of paralegals, because theres software that can sumup case laws and legal briefs and decisions. You dont need human assistants for that anymore, I read the other day about a program where you feed it abox score from a baseball or football game, and it spits out a news article, as if a human had watched the game and was commenting on it. And obviously, these new technologies cant do as clever or creative a job as the humans theyrereplacing, but theyre faster and crucially, theyre much much cheaper. So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be. Ive read economists saying that as a result of these new technologies well enter a new golden age of leisure. When well all have time for the things we really love, because all these on erous tasks will be taken over by Watson. and his digital Brethrenive heard other people say, quite the opposite that this is yet, another tier of the middle class thats having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology, and that this is actually somethingomino us something that we should worry about. Im not an economist myself. all I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work. And it was friggin demoralizing. It was terrible. Heres the one thing that I was ever good at. and all it took was, Ibmpouring tens of millions of dollars, and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel, and they could do the same thing, they could do it a little bit faster, and a little better on national TV. and Im sorry ken we dont need you anymore. and it made me think, What does this mean. If were going to be able to start outsourcing, not just lower unimportant brain functions, Im sure many of you remember a distant time. when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends phone numbers. And suddenly, there was a machine that did that. And now we dont need to remember that anymore. I have read that theres now actually evidence that the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships, physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like GPS because were not exercising our sense of direction anymore. Were just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard. And as a result, a part of our brain thats supposed to do that kind of stuff gets smaller and dumber, and it made me think what happens when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are is all of our brain going to start to shrink and a trophy like that. Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledgeless. As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know this was a terrifying idea to me. The more I thought about it, I realized, no its still important. the things we know are still important. I came to believe there were two advantages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says, Oh, Yeah, I can Google that hold on a second, theres an advantage of volume. and theres an advantage of time. The advantage of volume first just has to do with the complexity of the world. Nowadays, theres so much information out there being a renaissance manor woman, thats something that was only possible in the renaissance. Now, its really not possible to be reasonably educated on e very field of human endeavor. Theres just too much. They say that the scope of human information is now doubling every 18 months or so the sum total of human information that means between now and late 2014, we will generate as much information in terms of gigabytes, as all of humanity, has in all the previous millenia put together. Its doubling every 18 months. Now, this is terrifying. Because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts, a decision. Like where do I go to school. What should I major in whodo I vote for do I take this jobor that one these are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts. If we have those facts a t ourmental fingertips, were going to be able to make informed decisions. If on the other hand, we need to look them all up. We may be in trouble. According to a National geographic survey. I just saw somewhere along the lines of 80 percent of the people who vote in a U.S presidential election about issues like Foreign policy can not find Iraq or Afghanista n on a map if you cant do that first step, Are you really going to look up. The other thousand facts. Youre going to need to know to mastery, our knowledge of us foreign policy, quite probably not at some point, youre just going to be like. You know, what. Theres too much to knows crew it and youll make a less informed decision. The other issue is the advantage of time that you have. if you have all these things at your fingertips, I always think of the story of a little girl name. d tilly Smith. She was a 10 year old girl from Surrey. England on vacation with her parents a few years ago in phuket Thailand she runs up to them on the Beach one morning and says, Mom Dad, weve got to get off the beach, and they say, What do you mean, we just go there. And she said In MrKearneys, geography class last month, he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea. And you see the waves churning way out there. Thats the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach, what would you do. If your 10 year old daughter came up to you with this her parents thought about it. And they finally to their credit decided to believe her they told the lifeguard. They went back to the Hotel and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach. Luckily, because that was the day of the boxing Day tsunami, the day after Christmas 2004, that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian ocean. But not on that beach not on Maik hao beach, because this little girl had remembered. one fact from her geography teacher a month before now when facts come in handy like that, I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact, one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time, Normally something thats easier to see on game shows than in real life. But in this case, it happened in real life, and it happens in real life all the time. Its not always a tsunaM. i often, its a social situation. Its a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated, because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge. You saywhere youre from. And I say. Oh, yeah, or your almamater or your job. And I know just a little something about it enough to get the ball rolling people love that shared connection that gets created when somebody knows something about you. Its like, they took the time to get to know you before you even met thats often the advantage of time, And its not effective if you say well hold on, youre from far go North Dakota. Let me see what comes up. oh. Yeah. Roger Maris Was from Fargo that doesnt work. Thats just annoying the great 18th century British theologian and thinker friend of Dr. Johns on. SAmuel Parronce said, its always better to know athing than not to know it. And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, its probably that, I have always believed that the things we know that knowledge is an absolute good that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are as individuals. And as a species, I dont know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete. I dont want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together. I dont want to be the last trivia know it all sitting on a mountain, somewhere reciting to himself The state capitals and the names of Simpsons episodes and the lyrics of abbasongs. I feel like our civilization works. When this is a vast, cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices to our search engines and our smartphones in the movies when computers like Watson start to think things dont alwaysend. well. those movies are never about beautiful utopias. Its always a terminator. Or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an air lock in 2001, things always go terribly wrong. And I feel like were sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in. This is a question of leadership. Because it becomes a question of who leads. The future on the one hand, we can choose between a new Golden age where information is more universally available than its ever been in human history, where we all have the answers to our questions at our finger tips, and on the other hand, we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia, where the machines have taken over, And weve all decided, its not important what we know any more that knowledge isnt valuable, because its all out there in the cloud. And why would we ever bother learning anything new. Those are the two choices we have I know, which future. I would rather be living in and we can all make that choice. We make that choice by being curious inquisitive people who like to learn who dont just say well as soon As the bell has rung, and the class is over. I dont have to learn anymore. Or thank Goodness, I have my diplomaIm done learning. for a lifetime. I dont have to learn new things anymore. No every day we should be striving to learn something new. We should have this unQ uenchable curiosity for the world around us. Thats where the people you see on Jeo pardy come from. these know italls, theyrenot rain mansty le savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book, Ive met a lot of them, for the most part, they are just normal folks who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything. Thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject we can live in one of these two worlds. We can live in a world where our brains the things that we know continue to be the thing that makes us special or a world in which weve outsourced all of that to evil super computers from the future, like Wats on, ladies and gentlemen, the choice is yours.

"So, I kind of believe that were in like the cave painting era of computer interfaces. Like, theyre very kind of, they dont go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and Id like to change all that. Hit me. OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right. Its very flat, kind of rigid. And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac, you know, but really its the kind of same old crap weve had for the last, you know, 30 years. Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers. I mean its point and click, its like the menus, icons, its all the kind of same thing. And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk. Its so much more subtle, so much more visceral, you know, whats visible, whats not. And Id like to bring that experience to the desktop. So I kind of have a, this is BumpTop. Its kind of like a new approach to desktop computing. So you can bump things, theyre all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff. And instead of that point and click, its like a push and pull, things collide as youd expect them. Just like on my real desk, I can, let me just grab these guys, I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have. And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid, or you know, flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. When theyre laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right. And then, its all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in todays interfaces. Also, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that. I just toss it to the pile, and its added right to the top. Its a kind of nice way. Also some of the stuff we can do is, for these individual icons we thought, I mean, how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further. And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important. But whats really cool is that since theres a physics simulation running under this, its actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesnt really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right. So its cute, but its also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right. This is heavy so it feels more important. So its kind of cool. Despite computers everywhere paper really hasnt disappeared, because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties. And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. So one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them, just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later. Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up and, you know, toss it to the corner. Also just like paper, around our workspace well pin things up to the wall to remember them later, and I can do the same thing here, and you know, youll see post it notes and things like that around peoples offices. And I can pull them off when I want to work with them. So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that, you know, Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I dont want that mess on my computer. So one thing we have for that is like a grid align, kind of, so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned. More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping. And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. Lets just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke. I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software, I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop, but browsing photographs. I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. I can toss these things around. Theyre so much more tangible and touchable, and you know I can double click on something to take a look at it. And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before. So I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know, okay, lets move this photo to the back, lets delete this guy here, and I think its just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information. And thats BumpTop.

"A cold January day of 2005, I took one of my most important drives of my life. I was on this road in upstate New York, trying to find this old factory. The day before, I received a flyer in the mail that said, Fully equipped yogurt plant for sale. I threw it in the garbage can. And 20 minutes later, I picked it up and called the number. The plant was 85 years old, and it was closing. So I decided to go see it. At this time, I wasnt sure where this road or my life was going. I owned a small cheese shop but really hated business. But the hills and the roads and the smells are all familiar. I grew up in Turkey, in a similar environment, near the Kurdish mountains. My family made cheese and yogurt. I grew up listening to shepherds stories. We didnt have much, but we had the moon and the stars, simple food, each other. Eventually, I came to America. I didnt even know New York had farms. I made it to upstate, and I never left. Now Im lost. I passed the road sign that said Dead end. Then soon after, there it was, the factory. The smell hit me first. It was a like a milk container left out in the sun. The walls were so thick, paints were peeling, there were cracks everywhere. The factory was so old, the owners thought it was worthless. I thought they left a zero off, I couldnt believe the price. As I entered in, I stopped noticing things. All I could see were the people. There were 55 of them. Just quiet. Their only job was to break the plant apart and close it forever. I was met with a guy named Rich, the production manager. He offered to take me around, show me around. He didnt say much, but around every corner, he would point out some stories. Rich worked there for 20 years. His father made yogurt before him, and his grandfather made cream cheese before that. You could tell that Rich felt guilty that this factory was closing on his watch. What hit me the hardest at that time was that this wasnt just an old factory. This was a time machine. This is where people built lives, they left for wars, they bragged about home runs and report cards. But now, it was closing. And the company wasnt just giving up on yogurt, it was giving up on them. As if they were not good enough. And I was shocked how these people were behaving. There was no anger, there were no tears. Just silence. With grace, they were closing this factory. I was so angry that the CEO was far away, in a tower or somewhere, looking at the spreadsheets and closing the factory. Spreadsheets are lazy. They dont tell you about people, they dont tell you about communities. But unfortunately, this is how too many business decisions are made today. I was never the same person after what I saw. On my way back home, I called Mario, my lawyer. I called Mario, I said, Mario, I want to buy this place. Mario said, Hamdi, one of the largest food companies in the world is closing this place, and theyre getting out of the yogurt business. Who the hell are you to make it work. I said, Youre right. But the next day, I called him again, and I said, Mario, really, I really want to buy this place. He said, Hamdi, you have no money. You havent even paid me in six months. Which was true. But I got a loan, another loan. By August 2005, I had the keys for this factory. The first thing I did was to hire four of the original 55 people. I had Maria, the office manager. I had Frank, the wastewater guy. I had Mike, the maintenance guy. And Rich, who showed me the plant, the production guy. And we had our first board meeting. Mike says, Hamdi, what are we going to do now. They look at me as if I have the magic answer. So I said, Mike, were going to go to Ace Hardware store, and were going to get some paints. And were going to paint the walls outside. Mike wasnt impressed. He looked at me. He said, Hamdi, thats fine, well do that, but tell me you have more ideas than that. I said, I do. Well paint the walls white. Honest to God, that was the only idea I had. But we painted those walls that summer. I sometimes wonder what they would have said to me if I told them, See these walls were painting. In two years, were going to launch a yogurt here that Americans have never seen and never tasted before. It will be delicious, it will be natural. And were going to call it Chobani, it means shepherd in Turkish. And if I said, We are going to hire all of the 55 employees back, or most of them back. And then 100 more after, and then 100 more after, and then 1,000 more after that. But if I told them, You see that town over there. Every person we hire, 10 more local jobs will be created. The town will come back to life, the trucks will be all over the roads. And the first money we make, were going to build one of the best Little League baseball fields for our children. And five years after that, were going to be the number one Greek yogurt brand in the country. Would they have believed me. Of course not. But thats exactly what happened. In painting those walls, we got to know each other. We believed in each other. And we figured it out together. Five years, me and all my colleagues, we never left the factory. We worked day and night, through the holidays, to fix that plant. The best part of Chobani for me is this, the same exact people who were given up on were the ones who built it back 100 times better than before. And they all have a financial stake in the company today. And all this time, I kept wondering, you see, Im not a businessman, I dont come from that tradition, I just kept wondering. What is this all about. Corporate America says its about profits. Mainstream business says its about money. The CEO playbook says its about shareholders. And so much is sacrificed for it, its factories, communities, jobs. But not by CEOs. CEOs have their employees suffer for them. But yet, the CEOss pay goes up and up and up. And so many people are left behind. Im here to tell you, no more. Its not right, its never been right. Its time to admit that the playbook that guided businesses and CEOs for the last 40 years is broken. It tells you everything about business except how to be a noble leader. We need a new playbook. We need a new playbook that sees people again. That sees above and beyond profits. In the movies, they have a name for people who take a different path to do things right. They call them antiheroes. I think we need the same idea in business. We need anti CEOs, and we need an anti CEO playbook. So let me tell you about what this anti CEO playbook is all about. An anti CEO playbook is about gratitude. Todays business book says, business exists to maximize profit for the shareholders. I think thats the dumbest idea Ive ever heard in my life. In reality, business should take care of their employees first. You know, a few years ago, when we announced that we are giving shares to all our 2,000 employees, some people said its PR, some said its a gift. I said, its not a gift. I watched it, Ive been part of it. They earned it with their talent and with their hard work, and I dont see any other way. The new way of business, its your employees you take care of first. Not the profits. The new anti CEO playbook is about community. Today, the businesses that have it all ask communities, What kind of tax breaks and incentives can you give me. The reality is, businesses should go to the struggling communities and ask, How can I help you. When we wanted to build our second yogurt plant, Idaho was on nobodys radar screen. It was too rural, too far away, didnt have much incentives. So I went there. I met with the local people, I met with the farmers. We shook hands, we broke bread. I said, I want to build it right here. I dont need to see financial studies. And the result, its community is thriving. Theres new schools that open every year. New food companies are coming up every year. And they told me, Youre not going to find any trained workers here. I said, Its OK, well teach them. We partnered with the local community college, and while we were building the plant, we trained hundreds of hundreds of people for advanced manufacturing. And today, our factory is one of the largest yogurt plants in the world. The new way of business, communities. Go search for communities that you can be part of. Ask for permission. And be with them, open the walls and succeed together. The anti CEO playbook is about responsibility. Todays playbook says, the businesses should stay out of politics. The reality is businesses, as citizens, must take a side. When we were growing in New York and looking for more people to hire, I remembered that in Utica, an hour away, there were refugees from Southeast Asia and Africa, who were looking for a place to work. They dont speak English, someone told me. I said, I dont really, either. Lets get translators. They dont have transportation. I said, Lets get buses, its not a rocket science. Today, in one of Americas rural areas, 30 percent of the Chobani workforce are immigrants and refugees. And it changed us for better. The new way of business, its business, not government, in the best position to make a change in todays world, in gun violence, in climate change, in income inequality, in refugees, in race. Its business that must take a side. And lastly, an anti CEO playbook is about accountability. Todays playbook says, the CEO reports to the corporate boards. In my opinion, CEO reports to consumer. In the first few years of Chobani, the 1 to 800 number on the cup was my personal number. When somebody called and wrote, I responded personally. Sometimes I made changes based on what I heard, because consumer is in power. Thats the reason the business exists. Its you, every single one of you is in power to make changes today. If you dont like the brand and the companies, what they are doing with their business, you can throw them into the garbage can. And if you see the ones that are doing it right, you can reward them. In the end, this is all in our responsibility. The new way of business, its the consumer we report to, not to the corporate boards. You see, if you are right with your people, if you are right with your community, if you are right with your product, you will be more profitable, you will be more innovative, you will have more passionate people working for you and a community that supports you. And thats what the anti CEO playbook is all about. The treasure that I found in that factory, dignity of work, strength of character, human spirit, is what we need to unleash all across the world. Brothers and sisters, there are people and places all around the world left out and left behind. But their spirit is still strong. They just want another chance, they want someone to give them a chance again, not to just build it back, but build it better than before. And this is the difference between return on investment and return on kindness. This is the difference between profit and true wealth. And if it can happen in a small town in upstate New York and Idaho, it can happen in every city and town and village across the world.

cold. January Day of 2005, I took one of my most important drives of my life. I was on this road in upstate New York, trying to find this old factory the day Before. I received a flyer in the mail that said fully equipped yogurt plant forsALe. I threw it in the garbage can and 20 minutes later, I picked it up and called. The Number tHe plant was 85 years old, and it was closing. So I decided to go see it. At this time. I wasnt sure where this road or my life was going. I owned a small cheese shop, but really hated business, but the hills and the roads, and the smells are all familiar. I grew up in Turkey, in a similar environment Near the Kurdish mountains, my family made cheese and yogurt, I grew up listening to shepherds stories. We didnt have much, but we had the moon and the stars simple food each other. eventually, I came to America. I didnt even know New York had farms. I made it to up state, and I never left. Now Im lost. I passed the road sign. that said Deadend. Then soon. After there it was the factory, the smell hit me. first. It was a like a milk container left out in the sun the walls were. so thick paints were peeling, there were cracks every where the factory was so old the owners thought it was worth less. I thought they left a ze ro off. I couldnt believe the price. As I entered in, I stopped noticing things all I could see were the people there were 55 of them just quiet their only job was to break the plant apart and close it forever. I was met with a guy named Rich the production Manager, he offered to take me around show me around he didnt say much, but around every corner, he would point out. Some stories rich worked there for 20 years, his father, made yogurt before him and his grandfatherma de cream cheese before that, you could tell that rich felt guilty that this factory was closing on his watch what hit me the hardest at that time was that this wasnt just an old factory. This was a time machine. this is where people built lives, they left for wars. They bragged about home runs and report cards, But now it was closing, and the company wasnt just giving upon Yogurt. it was giving up on them, as if they were not good enough. And I was shocked how these people were behaving. There was no anger, there were no tears just silence with grace. They were closing this factory. I was so angry that the CEO was far away in a tower or some where looking at the spreadsheets and closing the factory spreadsheets are lazy. They dont tell you about people, they dont tell you about communities, but unfortunately, this is how too many business decisions are made today. I was never the same person after what I saw. On my way back home. I called mario. My lawyericalLed Mario. I said, Mario, I want to buy this place mario SAid ham dione of the largest food companies in the world is closing this place, and theyre getting out of the yogurt business. who the hell are you to make it work. I said, youre right. But the next day, I called him again, and I said, Mario really, I really want to buy this place. He said, Hamdi, you have no money. You havent even paid me in six months, which was true. but I got a lO an another loan by August 2005, I had the keys for this factory. The first thing I did was to hire four of the original 55 people I had maria. the office Manager, I had Frank the wastewater guy, I had. Mike the maintenance guy and rich who showed me the plant the production guy. and we had our first board meeting. Mike say shaMdi. What are we going to do. Now, they look at me as if I have the magic answer. So I said, Mike, were going to go to ace hardware store, and were going to get some paints. and were going to paint the walls outside. Mike wasnt impressed. He looked at me, He said, ham di, thats fine. Well do that. but tell me You have more ideas than that. I said, I do. Well paint the walls. White honest to God. That was the only ideai had, But we painted those walls. That summer I sometimes wonder, what they would have said to me, if I told them see these walls were painting in two years. Were going to launch a yogurthere that Americans have never seen and never tasted before. It will be delicious. It will be natural, and were going to call it ChobaNi. It means shepherd in Turkish, and if I said, we are going to hire all of the 55 employees back or most of them back and then 100 more after and then 100 more after and then 1,000 more after that. But if I told them, you see that town over there, every person, we hire 10 more local jobs will be created the town will come back to life. The trucks will be all over the roads and the first money we make. Were going to build one of the best little league baseball fields for our children. And five years after that, were going to be the Number one Greek Yogurt brand in the country would they have believed me, of course, not. But thats exactly what happened in painting. Those walls. We got to know each other, we believed in each other, and we figured it out to gether five years me. And all my colleagues, we never left the factory. We worked day and night through the holidays to fix that plant. The best part of Choban I for me is this the same exact people who were given up on were the ones who built it back 100 times better than before. And they all have a financial stake in the company today, and all this time, I kept wondering, you see, Im not a business man. I dont come from that tradition. I just kept wondering, what is this all about corporate America says. Its about profits. Mainstream business says, Its about money. the CeO play book says, Its about shareholders and so much is sacrificed for it. Its factories communities jobs, but not by CeosCeos have their employees suffer for them. But yet, the cEoss pay goes up and up and up, and so many people are left behind. Im here to tell you no more its not right. Its never been right. Its time to admit that the play book that guided businesses and CEos, for the last 40 years is broken. It tells you everything about business, except how to be a noble leader. We need a new playbook. We need a new playbook that sees people again that sees above. and beyond profits in the movies, they have a name for people who take a different path to do things right. They call themanti heroes, I think we need the same ideain business. We need anticeos, And we need an anticeo play book. So let me tell you about what this anti ceo playboOk is, all about an anti Ceoplaybook is about gratitude. Todays business book says, business exists, to maximize profit for the shareholders. I think thats the dumbest idea. Ive ever heard in my life. In reality. Business should take care of their employees first, you know, a few years ago, when we announced that we are giving shares to all our 2,000 employees. Some people said It Sprsome said, Its a gift. I said, Its not a gift. I watched it. Ive been part of it. The y earned it with their talent, and with their hard work, And I dont see any other way, the new way of business, its your employees, you take care of first not the profits. The New Anti Ceo playbook, is about community. today the businesses that have it all ask communities, what kind of taxbreaks and incentives, can you give me. The reality is businesses should go to the struggling communities and ask, How can I help you when we wanted to build our second yogurt PlanTIdaho was on nobodys radar screen. It was too rural too, far away didnt have much incentives. So I went there I met with the local people I met with the farmers. We shook hands, we broke bread. I said, I want to build it right here. I dont need to see financial studies. And the result its community is thriving. Theres new schools that open every year new food. companies are coming up every year. And they told me, Youre not going to find any trained workers here. I said, its OK, Well teach them, we partnered with the local community college. And while we were building the plant, we trained hundreds of hundreds of people for advanced manufacturing. And today, our factory is one of the largest yogurt plants in the world the new way of business communities, go search for communities that you can be part of ask for permission and be with them open the walls and succeed together. The anti ceoplaybook is about responsibility. To days play book says, The businesses should stay out of politics. The reality is businesses. As citizens must take a side when we were growing in New York and looking for more people to hire. I remembered that inuticaan hour away, there were refugees from South East Asia and Africa, who were looking for a place to work. they dont speak English. someone told me I said, I dont really either lets get translators. They dont have transportation. I said, Lets get buses. Its not a rocket science. today in one of Americ as rural areas. 30 percent of the chobanI workforce are immigrants and refugees. And it changed us for better the new way of business, its business not government in the best position to make a change in today, s worldingunviolence in climate change in income inequality in refugees in race its business that must take aside. And lastly, an anticeoplay book is about accountability. Todays playbook says, the CeO reports to the corporate boards, in my opinion Ceo reports to consumer in the first few years of chobani. the 1 to 800 number on the cup was my personal number. When somebody called and wrote I responded, personally, sometimes I made changes based on what I heard, because consumer is in power. thats the reason the business exists, its you every single one of you is in power. to make changes. Today, if you dont like the brand, and the companies what they are doing with their business, you can throw them into the garbage can. and if you see the ones that are doing it, right, you can reward them. In the end. This is all in our responsibility the new way of business. Its the consumer. we report to not to the corporate boards. You see, if you are right with your people, if you are right with your community. if you are right with your product, you will be more profitable you will be more innovative, you will have more passionate people working for you and a community that supports you. And thats what the anti ceO playboOk is all about. The treasure that I found in that factory dignity of work strength of character, human spirit is what we need to unleash all across the world brothers and sisters. There are people and places all around the world, left out and left behind. But their spirit is still strong, they just want another chance. They want someone to give them a chance again, not to just build it back, but build it better than before. And this is the difference between return on investment and returnonkindness. This is the difference between profit and true wealth. And if it can happen in a small town in upstate New York, and I daho. it can happen in every city and town and village across the world. This is not the time to build walls. This is a time to start painting the walls. I leave the colors all up to you. Thank you so much."
